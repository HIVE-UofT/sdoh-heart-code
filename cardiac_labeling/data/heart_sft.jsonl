Even thought the waiting room was full, she did not rush with him.  After he had set his hand she went to walk out of the room, stopped, came back and sat on the bed with him an shared a story about her own son's struggle at school and pointed out that he should never punch a locker again.  That he needed to learn to walk away.  As a parent, I really appreciated that.  Sometimes what mom and dad say means nothing but to hear it from another adult in a position of respect might actually get through to him.  My only complaint and I hate to say anything since the doctor was SO AMAZING and KIND was that she did not wait long enough for the beta blocker to kick in before setting his hand.  She only waited a minute.  It took me and two nurses to hold him down as the bones were being set and I don't think that couldn't helped much to the quality of the set (it almost needed surgery).  He was writhing in pain and crying.  It was one of the worst experiences of my motherhood  The plastic surgeon at CHEO said that this is one of the most common errors in emergency medicine - not waiting long enough for the pain blockers to kick in.  Five minutes after the setting my son was remarking that he couldn't feel a thing and how he wished they had waited a bit longer.  We would not have minded if the doctor had left the room to speak to another patient and then come back to set it but I guess we couldn't lost the window all together if she could not get away from the net patient easily.  All this to say, it was a positive experience and we were so grateful for the care of the nurse and our wonderful doctor.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I saw my doctor XXXXXX. Symptoms were severe XXXXXXXX and I went into ED both XXXXXXXX and XXXXXX. The doctor I saw XXXXXXXX (Dr XXXXXXXXX) treated me poorly and rolled his eyes when I had told him my doctors instructions from previous day. Dr XXXXXXXXX also prescribed me Naproxen, which was definitely contraindicated to the medication I was taking (Fragmin blood thinner injections post partum as per my hematologist). He also did not seem concerned with the fact that I had a less than X week old newborn at home who I was breastfeeding, and I was very concerned with medications. Dr XXXXXXXXX first attempted to give an intramuscular antibiotic injection which after asking several times about the safety of this injection while breastfeeding, I finally received an IV antibiotic. Dr XXXXXXXXX still prescribed the naproxen even after I reminded him and the nurse about taking Fragmin injections. Luckily I am a health professional myself and did not fill the prescription and confirmed the following day that I should not be taking that medication. XXXXXX I returned to ED where I was treated by Dr XXXXXX and his resident Dr XXXX, where I received excellent care. I ended up going to XXXXXX for a CT then ended up getting sent to XXXXXX that evening to be seen by a specialist. The care I received from Dr XXXXXX and Dr XXXX was excellent. After being sent to XXXXXX and having multiple followup appointments in XXXXXX as well, I felt Dr XXXXXXXXX did not take my concerns and condition seriously enough. I consider myself lucky to have the background I have otherwise I could have ended up in worse condition then what I arrived with (with a XXX week old baby at home). The results of the survey were based solely on my experience on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, not XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. My care on XXXXXXXX I would rate extremely poorly. If I return to the ED in the future and Dr XXXXXXXXX is the treating physician, I will seek my care elsewhere. Again, the care received from Dr XXXXXX and Dr XXXX was excellent.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

There were 2 other nurses just sitting at the station and only one other patient in that area I find the young staff have no empathy compared to other staff. I know the hospital could do nothing about the COVID situation due to govt guidelines but I must state my opinion given a 2nd wave may come and were lessons learned? I am not clear as to how many OR's are in my hospital but I was told they were down to one only my surgery (breast cancer) was delayed twice due to COVID rules. Only loss of limb and life threatening were allowed during this time vs. elective surgery. The day of surgery I was bumped twice and surgery was delayed 6 ish hours. I was told there was a birth and an emergency. I believe I was later told there are 4 OR's at my hospital what sense does it make to close down so many of them and try to operate with so few. The collateral deaths because of this and other issues is unforgivable. My neighbours sister was one of them and would not have died in that case she was booted out of the hospital early. Told to go into a nursing home or whatever with only a very short notice she was forced to go home with no care and died of a heart attack alone days after I am sure this happened to many people and many who suffered unnecessarily when not receiving their scheduled surgeries. The govt chose to concentrate on COVID people only and the rest could go to hell basically to my knowledge the OR's and surgeons were not needed for that type of treatment you had hospitals with vacant rooms, nurses and doctors laid off etc who could have been saving patients if all OR's were kept operating. Some common sense was needed and not shutting down everything for the 3% of people who might or did get COVID in my town of 73,000 25 people died (seniors mostly in nursing homes) Let's hope lessons were learned and hospitals have more control of their practices based on their own area numbers.

I've experienced his 'bedside manner' myself and when taking my elderly mother in for health care. He basically mocks you or sighs when he feels you haven't answered a question to his satisfaction. I dislike how the registration area is set up. In this era of privacy concerns, the entire ED can hear you discuss your name/address/phone/emergency contact/health issues. There should be a more private area set-up for registration. The resident was very thorough, which was appreciated. I find that medical staff (nurses, doctors, residents) tend to gloss over the basics - not everyone knows how certain tests/medication/symptoms work, so a few extra seconds to explain would be greatly appreciated. Side note: my mother attended this ED 5 times over the course of 10 days (2 years ago) and was treated very poorly. She saw a different dr each time, who would say 'I don't know what's wrong with you, here are some meds, so go home'. Further tests were rarely ordered (one lower abdominal ultrasound, and a 'potential' CT scan in 7 weeks), despite severe pain, continual vomiting, and the inability to intake food for those 10 days - as a XXX year-old. In the end, we had to get her family dr involved to finally get her admitted to get testing done. After 10 days of vomiting and pain, the result was multiple pulmonary emboli, which could have killed her. But the ED drs just kept sending this senior citizen home to be someone else's problem another day. At that time, I did overhear one of the drs speaking with a nurse - they were concerned another patient had a heart attack, but weren't 100% sure. They were hesitating on following up for fear of being wrong and 'bothering' both the specialist and the 'nurse upstairs When I happened to be in the ED a few days after she was finally treated and released, one of the nurses who treated her on her 4th ED visit told me he didn't think she was going to live thru the night that evening. But yet the dr still sent her home with simple nausea meds that didn't help anything. So, as grateful as I am to have a local rural ED, they need to make some significant attitude improvements.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

The doctor came in a little later, ask the same question as the PA, she went out again. When she came back, she told me 'congratulations'. I asked what for and she told me the COVID shot was working, my body was doing it's job. I guess I was happy, it took 6 hours to find that out.

If I were to refer to my visit on XXXXXXXXXXX as opposed to my visit of XXXXXXXXXXX, my choices for each question would be quite different. On XXXXX, I was misdiagnosed by one doctor as having a possible intercostal muscle pain issue, and ended up returning three days later with much the same intense pain on XXXXX. Another more perceptive doctor properly diagnosed my condition as having a pulmonary embolism, to which I was promptly treated with the appropriate blood thinner. I feel mistakes such as this, and the inability to notify the first doctor of his mistake leads me to believe that corrective action and adequate feedback are not a priority with the medical profession. His misdiagnosis could have potential put me in grave danger, as PE's can be fatal if not taken care of in time. The condition in emerg on XXXXX are not the same ones that I have filled out this survey (referring to XXXXXXXXXXX). It is all well and good to present me with a survey that purports to take health care seriously for the citizens of XXXXXXXXX, but my personal experience over the last five years shows me that going to emerg here is nothing more than a crap shoot, with wide variations in service delivery. At times I would give the hospital and staff a 9 out of 10, and other times, barely a 2. This lack of consistency is perplexing, and not solely dependent on heavy case loads and busy periods. As a patient, set apart from the daily goings-on at this hospital, I fail to see why such a wide variation in quality health services can't be rectified, or possibly even identified. I have already received many of these surveys, and filled them out where others would just toss them in the garbage. Most people have already resigned themselves to accepting the current level of treatment, good or bad. I have also noted that certain numbers of patients waiting in emerg are chronic complainers, discontent the moment they arrived, and expect premium treatment within minutes. I assure you I'm not one of them. I realize it takes a team, one that works well together, and has the resources to provide the services we've come to expect for our tax dollars. Overall, I'd say there has been some noticeable improvement at the XXX, but feel it is still far from the mark of being above average. The problems are many, and even little changes would be a move in the right direction. But unless those things can be properly identified, nothing is going to change there, in my opinion. Surveys like this one are basically rigged to get the results it expects to get, and are so non-specific that the questions could be chopped down to three questions and still get the same result. Why would one's sexual orientation even matter when it comes to health care, or that I'm white, green or purple? Is that how health care issues are framed in this country? Until the survey questionnaire is amended, this will be the last one I will fill out.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

Anyway, she sent me around the corner to the wait and see room. When upon entry I was the fourth person there. After speaking with the second nurse and she was recording the details of why I was there, she was excellent. Then I was sent back out to wait. I sat for over 4 hours with no one seeing me. I understand triage, but there did not appear to be anyone in more or less distress than myself. I firmly believe because I was sitting quietly, waiting patiently, and not causing any distress they just took everyone else. I was very upset and got up and left. Which I have never done before.

I am very grateful for the care XXXXX received, however overall from a paediatric point of view it was a terrible experience. There was not enough nursing staff from the moment she was brought back to the cardiac/critical care section. A life labs nurse came first who was unable to get her bloodwork on her own so as the parent I had to assist her by pushing the vials into place to collect the blood. This took two tries and she told me that another nurse would be in to put in her I.V. I couldn't believe that she was going to be poked three times unnecessarily. The I.V. should have been put in first and the bloodwork taken from the I.V. From there the nursing staff seemed to be very overwhelmed and understaffed. There was a very kind janitor who was smiling and trying to help patients and families be at ease. The radiologist technician was super kind and relatable which was awesome. However, after the ultrasound came back clear XXXXX was transferred to the hallway to wait for the pediatrician I asked that she not be moved but I was told there was no other option and her space was needed now by someone more critical than she was. There was no privacy and she was left extremely vulnerable in a hospital gown on a bed with an IV in for all to see. Ambulances were coming and going and she was a scared XX year old girl. When the pediatrician came everyone in the hallway was able to hear what was being said and after that I vowed I would try my best to never bring my children here again. She had to change in a disgusting bathroom and walk to the washroom in a gown with grown men and women all around. The staff overall were adequate as unless we asked for something no one offered anything and most walked by as if we didn't exist. The pediatrician helped by making sure sure she was followed up with, but the process is so broken. A XX year old girl should never be left that vulnerable in a hallway with someone at her feet and someone at her head, and others all around with no privacy. If a classmate had broken their arm, or required stitches and came to the hospital they would have heard everything going on with XXXXX and would have been perhaps sitting on a chair not far away from her. This hospital does not adequately suit the needs of our community. I am looking forward for changes to come.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

From attachment - XXXXXXXXXXXX Our experiences @ XXXX 1. XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXX sent for chest x-ray - pneumonia - antibiotic - got worse - passing out and falling. 2. XXXXXXXX Pat was sent to the emerg (by ambulance) from her doctor's office. She was to weak to walk and was falling. 11 hrs. later she as told she was not sick enough to keep in the hospital. 3. XXXXXXXXX Back to emerg. Passing out and falling (still) After about 6 hrs. doctor came in and told her she was being admitted. He left and she climbed off the end of the bed. She was trying to climb back into bed when I walked in. She fell and has one very bad black eye and bleeding. They sent her for a CAT scan to make sure there was internal bleeding. She was told at 3:30 ish they had a bed. 7:30 moved to room XXXX. 11:30 ish moved to ICU after turning purple. Dr. XXXXXX came in next morning and right away sent her for an echocardiogram. Dr. XXXXXX reported next a.m. it was a massive heart attack. XXX was stabilized and moved to room XXXX. She was on an alarm but climbed out of bed and pulled out her catheter. XXX was there for 6 days and sent home. 3. XXXXXXXX XXX sent for chest x-ray - pneumonia - antibiotic. Sent to emerg at 12:30 and got admitted at 7:30 ish At 7 XXX's lips turned blue and nurse checked her. Got admitted at 7:30 ish after waiting for ambulances from XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX to be admitted. Hospital wanted to admit her at 11:00 p.m. but we refused. The pneumonia is causing delirium and XXX does not know where she is or what is happening. This is from experience from last 2 bouts. We are not blaming the nursing staff as we understand they are under staffed and can not watch every patient 24 hours a day. It is the system. There are not enough rooms or nurses (let's close some more XXXX). We are left wondering what may have been if XXX had been admitted on XXXXXXX and been under Dr. XXXXXX's care as it did not take long for him to order the echocardiogram and find the real problem. I also was the person who did the survey as XXX does not remember any of the circumstances from XXXXXXXX until a couple days before we left the hospital.

Afraid to use the call bell a second time, I waited, with blood dripping down my arm for a nurse to walk by to ask for assistance. After about 15 minutes, I was able to get a nurses attention.

The nurse replied you've got something wrong with your liver, you need to talk to your doctor and left. This was a surprise to me, nothing had been mentioned to me about my liver. I was in the hospital for cardiac reasons. I had to wait until the next day to talk to the doctor.  Turns out it was nothing serious, but I spent the evening worrying for nothing.

Upon arriving at your Emergency department I communicated my concern to the receptionist, who immediately sent me to a nurses' station. The nurse who greeted me there was curt and dismissive at first when I described my symptoms, including the high blood pressure.  When she took my bp it was 185/105, higher than it was earlier that morning.  She said little after that, and told me to wait until another nurse registered me.  This wait was about five minutes.  After this was done this nurse instructed me to sit in the waiting area with the other patients.  She did not say anything else, so I did as instructed, said nothing and sat down. I was in the waiting room for about two hours before being brought in by another nurse.  Note: the hospital had about half a dozen patients awaiting treatment and I was placed in this queue.  From this point on my experience was okay.  It took another hour or so to be seen by the doctor, an EKG administered by the nurse, and the doctor to follow up with and discharge me.  My two main points of concern for my visit was first the lack of courtesy, concern and empathy by the first nurse who dealt with me in Admissions, and second the overall lack of communication from everyone who dealt with me throughout my stay.  Fortunately I had no serious health repercussions from my hospital visit, so overall I rated my treatment as satisfactory.

I was admitted XXXXXXXXXXXXXX after a massive lower GI bleed.  The quality of care that I received while in ICU was exceptional to say the least.  I have nothing but positive remarks for the care that I received from doctors and nurses on the ICU floor.  Our Emergency Department, however, lacked in every way possible.  It was extremely disorganized & unprofessional.  Upon arrival, by ambulance to the hospital I was assessed in the emergency department; they did an ECG + blood work.  After waiting for some time I was sent out to answer additional questions with an admissions clerk + then sent to \"stand\" in the emergency department waiting room.  I left my place of work by ambulance, I was sweating excessively, confused, having difficulty with vision, extremely pale in appearance, blood in stool, vomiting + lost consciousness.  Actually it was in my report that when EMG arrived at 4:20 p.m. that day, that I had no pulse.  I had open heart surgery in XXXX to replace an aortic heart valve + because of this, I thought my mechanical heart valve could be malfunctioning.  So, to be brought by ambulance to the hospital + sent out to the waiting room did not seem appropriate.  Within 15-20 min. of standing in the emergency waiting room I started with the same symptoms I was experiencing at work.  Thankfully, I had family members with me.  I lost consciousness (as my blood pressure kept bottoming out); my wife ran to the xxxxx + indicated to her the urgency - the xxxxx looked up from her paperwork + responded \"I let them know\" + offered nothing else.  As I completely lost consciousness at this point + was on the floor, my daughter then ran up to the window + was told \"go see triage\" ... without any instruction, any assistance.  My daughter in law was calling out for help for a nurse to being out a blood pressure cuff ... nothing happened; no one helped.  My daughter opened the door to the Triage Room where a nurse was sitting inside + she took my blood pressure + at that point brought me back into emergency + out of the waiting room area.   Once in the back; I waited 5 hours, passing out an additional 4 times + having my worst \"bleed out\" at 10:00 p.m.   The resident doctor, when we could find her insisted a few times (conversations) that I probably had a flu/virus due to the fact that I was 'vomiting' + 'hot' earlier.  When I asked her why it's possible there was blood in my stool, she passed it off that based on scope results from 2 years ago that I could have had hemorrhoids.  She even mentioned that I could possibly be released that night.  The resident doctor was going off \"assumption\" at his point + clearly was not doing a \"proper assessment\".  My chart was randomly sitting on a chair (outside of soiled linens), only for a cleaner to pick up + deliver back to the nurse's station.  My wife had to assist me to the washroom ( as we were told no one was available to help) + that is when I had my massive bleed out.  My wife had to drag myself + the IV Tower from the washroom back to my stretcher in the hallway + I lost consciousness again.  At his point, my wife yelled out for assistance as my conditions was clearly worsening as I lay on the stretcher.  Waiting for what, I wasn't sure?  A nurse aided us + once I told her what had just happened .. with the severity for blood loss, she checked my charts + informed us that there was no indication of \"blood\" loss in my charts + this \"totally changed everything\".  Within no time I was brought up to ICU where I spent the next 13 days. A blood transfusion started immediately; eventually receiving 26 pints of blood during my stay.  Every test was performed + I received the critical care that I required.  The emergency service however, was not great.  This is my story + I hope it helps to make improvements in the areas needed.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

I was writhing in pain when she did blood work I asked what was wrong, she was defensive to the point of being rude. Once blood work taken, I was returned to second waiting room to wait for xray. No other communication. I was in so much pain and the care was so terrible that I asked physician (as I was on way to xray) if I could go home after that. He gave me appt for ultrasound, (the following day) I had xray and left. Note my primary nurse was sitting @ nurse's station \"chatting\" with other nurses and on her cell phone. ER physician was aware of my poor treatment by her and that this was reason for me leaving. I have never been treated so poorly in ER anywhere. She doesn't deserve to have a job. And I had ultrasound @ XXXX as scheduled. Radiologist called my GP within an hour. I had acute cholegystitis and I spoke to a surgeon within the week & had a lap chole on XXXXXXXXXX so I was in real pain with an acute diagnosis. She treated me as if I was wasting her time.

We were assured that they are working to improve conditions in the department There has been zero change since then. I sat in a wheelchair from 1530+ to 2300 when discharged I did not speak to a RN until taken into exam room where I stayed in the same wheelchair. I had a severely infected ankle that needed to be elevated. No RN came into the waiting are to assess patients and the pathetic sign that said \"any change in condition etc\" doesn't mean anything to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX!!! The waiting room was not quite full There was a little girl running up & down in no distress. I thought she was a visitor It turned out she was a hand injury She could have been assessed and discharged hours before she actually was! It only took a few minutes I saw it done There was a man with back pain, pacing and rubbing his back. After I had been there a few hours, his moans became louder At one point he asked if he could get something for pain and was told Not until seen by MD: Really the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX has a directive that would allow her to give analgesia medication The neglect shown the patients in the waiting room was pathetic. When I worked at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ER we kept nurses notes on patients in XX If pain medication was needed, we gave it according to directives. If blood work was indicated, it was done. If pt needed x-rays, the doctor was consulted and the x-ray was done before the patients went inside. This was our standard  of care for everyone who came into the department EKG also done - by the nurses. no techs when your nurses don't even venture into the waiting room, you have a long way to go. I was ordered and given an IV dose of antibiotics, with the plan to have me return in the morning for a second dose and then to receive oral medications. I suggested that since I was an RN they could give me the medication and I could do it at home. The next time I saw the doctor, he told me that he has changed his mind and he would give me a prescription for oral medication. My IV was discontinued after the (unreadable) was done and the doctor came in and gave me a prescription for Septa double strength and told me to fill it and start it in the morning It was now 2300 hrs. I can't walk properly, I am XX yrs young and I don't have a magic wand to get this filled immediately to start getting the antibiotic in me A nice gesture would have been to give me a pill to take home so I could start early morning.

A few of the nursing staff had a very callous attitude & when I asked questions regarding my husband's care they seemed very unsure of what was his care plan. The kitchen help bringing the trays of food in the room placed the table over near the wall or window prior to my serving. A lot of patients require assistance with meals. The day of \"candy stripers\" was the best! I spent many hours assisting while my husband was in hospital & I have a disability (use a walker). Also communication was not good with doctors & attending to my husband. I had no call as I had requested from nursing staff as to what my husband's status was - was it CHF - pneumonia or what?? I realize the pandemic has altered many things in our lives. There were numerous times the nurses were very busy chatting at their station with each other while is food waiting for (unreadable) once at the counter. There seem to be a need for more senior supervision. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Nursing staff should refrain from constantly suggesting a patient should be placed in LTC. This is not their call. This is a family decision. We (my son & I) are caring for my husband with some PSW care. This is our desire and we are doing an excellent job.

Anything else (e.g. comments from relatives, other departments, general hospital feedback) is “No”.", "input": "Comment: \"1. Nurses (except 2) were rude and negligent. I had more than 10 doctors. They were not consistent. I asked a question to 1 doctor and more than once she said she \"didn't know\". All she did was she had so many months and days before she became a doctor. THEN WHY DO THEY SEND ME THESE PEOPLE WHEN I'M SO SICK I CAN'T EVEN TALK JUST TO FILL IN TIME. Some student residents have a severe attitude problem. It's like they're doing me a favour just by being there!! Doctors were not always on the same page, inconsistent with diagnosis. 2. Before being admitted I went to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX urgent care. They gave me an x-ray & an antibiotic & sent me home. The next day I called an ambulance & they kept me in the hall for 3 hours. I kept complaining I had trouble breathing. They said I was fine, I WAS NOT, my lungs were swimming in fluid the doctor there said they were sending me home! I said NO - take another x-ray, they did & my pneumonia had DOUBLED!! 3) The female doctor who wanted to send me home at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was Dr. XXXXXX. It is my understanding that people who have pleural effusion and are sent home after being in the hospital usually die after 30 days, and this doctor wanted to send me home! I would like to go over some incidents that have happened to me while in the  hospital. Since the beginning, a nurse showed her disrespect and uncaring towards me. When I called for a nurse (on a signaling device) she either came late or not at all. My disease was not treated seriously at all. Then I began seeing a fleet of student doctors. I ws in the hospital for two weeks and they told me that I wasn't getting better or worse. I felt terrible. My breathing was getting worse. All I was told was that I had pneumonia and that I had a lung infection. I took a lot of chest x-rays and had 2 CT scans. On one occasion, a PSW worker came to my room and helped me on a bed to take me downstairs to have an x-ray. I still had to wear a mask and she gave me one that was a little tight around my nose so I wore it a little higher on my face. As we were going out in the hall, she said, \" I have a real winner here\", I felt too miserable to respond. The the respirologists came in. There was one junior resident in particular who acted as the typical \"hot shot know it all student\" who felt he was made of gold. His name is XXXXXXXXXXXXX. On one occasion he made a spontaneous diagnosis and made a VERY disrespectful comment to me IN FRONT OF MY SON. He was so eager to show off his \"knowledge\" without proof in front of everyone at my expense. (His diagnosis has since been unproven with scientific fact). Shortly after this incident I made a complaint about him to the doctor who was in charge of the team at the time. XXXXXXX is a protege of Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX who is the Respirologist specialist at XXXX who also teaches and is a career developer for these residents. (I later met Dr. XXXXX and he is one of the rudest, coldest, snobbiest and arrogant people I have ever met). To me, I do not care how educated he is in medicine, he is a very bad choice in mentoring these residents. Now I know where these residents get their negative and arrogant behaviour from. If you must keep him, keep him in a classroom and away from patients - HE DOES NOT HAVE THE PATIENCE NOR BEDSIDE  MANNER patients deserve. The hospital needs someone who is \"grounded\" and can teach positive examples towards a good Doctor and patient relationship. I will return to Doctor XXXXX later. During my third week at the hospital, they had removed over one liter of fluid from my right lung only. A doctor who I never met came in one day and said that I had \"only one-half liter\" of fluid in my left lung and that they were sending me home. They could not put a tube in my left lung because they were afraid of piercing an organ. So they gave me a months supply of antibiotics hoping that the fluid would dry up by itself and sent me home. My question is this: if during the first tweeks they had me taking antibiotics and had me on IVs 24 hours a day, how am I going to get better on antibiotics alone? Not only this, he said I could got back to work. I still felt congested and I still could not take a full breath from my lungs. It hurt when I did so. I did go home that day because I had no choice. I did not feel ready to go. I was given a follow up appointment to see \"Dr.\" XXXXXXX in XXXXXX. During that meeting he came in late. I had questions - he was annoyed and I felt rushed. I left not feeling satisfied with my responses. Please note that when I was in the hospital I had more than ten Doctors coming into my room, sometimes with different answers and at times with \"I don't know\" comments. I came home and did not feel ready to go back to work as I have a very demanding and physical job. I had a follow up meeting with him for the end of XXXXXXX. I called the Respirologist office at XXXX and asked the secretary if I could have an earlier meeting with Mr. XXXXX (whom I had not met) for a more in-depth diagnosis. She gave me an earlier meeting. I remember I was sitting in the waiting room. Then a woman with a very heavy eastern European accent came to get me. She was very cold, indifferent and in my opinion rude. She was short, heavy set with dark glasses. She just went through had to say. I felt rushed. Then after a while Dr. XXXXX came in. Already, it seemed he had a preset opinion of me. I was very polite using the word Dr. and \"sir\". It seemed that he already had a \"meeting\" with \"Dr.\" XXXXXXX and that I was the troublesome one. I had asked him \"do I have pleurisy\" he said he didn't know. He said I might have emphysema becuase I smoked. I never had a cigarette in my life. He confirmed that there was still fluid in my lungs. Since I still had trouble breathing, I asked if the fluid could affect my lungs and if my heart was OK. In a very rude tone and irritated facial expression he said \"I don't know, I'm not a heart specialist!\" I asked this because my father had congested heart failure. It was clear to me that he did not go through my file thoroughly. He did check my x-ray I had that morning and that was it. This was my impression. He wsa given information from his resident that all my questions were answered when in fact they weren't. Only after asking questions do I get new information and even now I am not satisfied. I feel it is because I am old and what I feel no longer matters. He admitted I need further breathing tests. He referred me back to my GP. I feel like a bouncing ball now being tossed back and forth. Since the very first day in the emergency rom everyone told me that I felt sick because of \"anxiety\" and the very frightening part of all this is that THEY STILL FEEL I have trouble breathing because of anxiety. The very scary part of all this is that my own GP feels this too. Doctors protecting doctors. IN CONCLUSION, the way I was treated at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a DISGRACE! I feel that this whole ordeal has left me frightened about what to expect from the hospital and from doctors in the future. I felt I wasn't taken seriously from the day I called the ambulance because I was a senior; they did not listen to me. They said I had anxiety. I did have a couple of excellent doctors and nurses with good intent but they were very few. I am a senior citizen and DO NOT feel protected by the health system. I was treated rudely, with disrespect, offended and very much neglected. I am a very friendly outgoing person who did not give these people any reason to treat me like this; if I was sent home that first day, surely I WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MONTH! I do not know what is going on presently with the Doctors and their contracts but it seems like senior citizens are being blamed for the increase in health costs. Are health providers trying to kill us off in order to reduce costs so they can make more money? I recomm that there be a separate health system only for senior citizens and that this lack of empathy and very dangerous behavior demonstrated by some of health care professionals be investigated. We are still alive and deserve respect! Yes, I can imagine what is going in senior homes and how many seniors are feeling isolated and frightened. Who is going to die next? Please change the system, especially towards the elderly. You don't need more money to learn to be respectful and show basic human kindness to those who need it. I feel especially angry and puzzled when I see that those at the top who can really do something about this are being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and nothing changes; they retire, resign or move on to bigger and better things. Everything I have said in this report is true. I am not just another crazy senior whose life does not matter anymore. There is more that I would like to say but would take too long. The bottom line is that the doctors are always right and the health care system is getting very dangerous for seniors. If you try to say something, you are either crazy or suffer from \"anxiety\". I hope this reports remains confidential and that those who can really make a difference are made aware of what is going on. Just open your eyes and look around your. If doctors are in the profession only for the money I guess they go south and for those who think that seniors are to blame, remember this: \"What I am presently, one day you will become\". PS I would really love the Health Minister to see this. To date, I still don't know what my official diagnosis is. Please help fix the system. We need people who care. I have lost faith in the health care system.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

My stay was horrible, and at XX years of age, one I will never forget. In no particular order, the following is my list of complaints regarding my stay. The room had no radio or television. The nursing station arranged for the connection of a television, but it did not work. My husband had to track down the company providing the so- called service, and they finally agreed to cancel any charges on our Master card. I have no sight in my left eye, and the right eye is very poor. My left hand is virtually useless as a result of an operation a few years ago. I wear hearing aids, but unless someone helped me set them in the charger overnight, they would not work. It was obvious that I needed help during my stay. However, when I asked for assistance the usual reply was \"I am not your nurse\" or \"someone will be with you shortly\", but often nobody came. I realize that the staff are under a great deal of stress due to the added workload of covid 19, however there was a definite lack of care and understanding. The most awful experience was on my first morning there, with noprevious warning or discussion, a male nurse (XXXX) took me by wheelchair to the bathroom and started removing my gown, and proceeded to give me a shower. He did not do anything improper, but it was an awful experience, and one that I will never forget, lacking in all understanding, or attention to my tears and protests. There was absolutely no need for this, and there were several female nurses who could have performed this duty. In conclusion, my husband made several trips to the hospital to bring me fresh clothing etc. It is a terrible experience for both of us knowing that we are so close, me on the fifth floor and XXXX in the lobby, and yet not allowed to see each other, and not knowing if we would ever see each other again. This is my report which my husband has typed for me, to be forwarded with the survey. Your truly, XXXXXXXXXXXXX (Mrs.) Please refer to additional comments attached. PS Since the above hospitalization. I was again admitted to XXXX with heart failure, from the XXX of XXXXX to the XXXX of XXXXXXXXXX. I was dreading the thought of ever going to the hospital again. Fortunately, this latest experience was altogether different from the previous one described above. Even though I was on the same 5th floor, cardiology, the treatment by the doctors and nurses was much improved. Your second survey request has been received, but of course it will NOT be returned. Please do not send any further surveys. You may send the above comments in this letter to XXXX if you wish.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

But that would not give the answers they are looking for I am sending a copy of this to emerg. to member of parliament, to the medical team, as well as a thank you to the resp. team who saved my life. XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX My hope is someone who cares will read this and take some action!! The hospital phoned the next day. The questions were not helpful and you were not given time to respond.

No questions on how are you feeling are you coping is there anything you need. Questions that would have been helpful.I would have died if I had not been a XXXXX + request resp. team To whom it may concern I would like to share with you my experience in the hosp. I went to the emergency hosp. XXXXXXXXXXX via ambulance. I was experiencing extreme pain in my upper outer chest wall. It was a pulsing pain. I was started on O2 as my oxygen level was low. I went for numerous tests and my oxygen level was never tested again as each time I came back I was placed in a different area. I was diagnosed with pneumonia and sent home (I had no fever, no cough - no symptoms of pneumonia) I was given a prescription for an antibiotic. Upon awakening the next morning, I was in extreme pain in the same area + now it was across the whole front of my chest as well. I was coughing up bld. streaked mucous. Back to the hosp. via ambulance + put on O2 I was placed in the front area where I waited 3 1/2 hrs. The pain was so severe and I was still coughing up bld. streaked mucous. I went to the triage nurse who said you have pneumonia and it will get worse before it gets better. The pain was so severe I was told I would not see a doctor for another 2 hrs. I could not sit in the wheelchair any longer I left. I went to the family dr. the next morning My pulse was rapid + the pain unbearable with a note from my dr. I went  back to emerg. was seen within an hour and admitted and started on a new antibiotic. Once admitted the nurses brought me my pills as ordered, but never had a chance to talk with me. I was handed a bath in a bag and my meals brought to me. I was feeling horrible - it was all I could do to get to the bathroom and back and I was taking pain pills every 4 hrs. I heard the respiratory team announce themselves as they went into another room I asked if the respiratory team could see me. (I was on the resp. floor) I give credit to whoever listened to my request - the respiratory team came & asked me 5 questions and they said they were sure I had a pulmonary embolus. I was sent for a CT scan and the diagnosis confirmed I had 2 pulmonary embolus one in each lung, and they were both large. I was started on bld thinners. Pulmonary embolus is usually fatal I was in the hosp. 3x in emerg. and was on the resp. floor (under a med. team) for 5 days before I was diagnosed and I would not have seen a resp. dr. if I had not asked to see them. I would have died The day after I was admitted I started coughing up clots with them becoming larger. No one seemed to care The nurses saw them and so did the medical team. When you have pneumonia and are started on antibiotics you get better (or start to) I was getting worse. No one took the time to talk to me!!! The resp. team knew what was wrong with me after asking me 5 questions and listening to what I was saying The nurses on the floor are busy You get a bath in a bag - your family members are expected to help you. Your bed is not changed or made unless you do it. These might seem as trivial but this is the time the nurse can talk with a pt. and observe the pt. for longer then 2 mins. This is the time when symptoms can be picked up. A nurse is far more then a pair of hands handing out meds and taking vitals. They are the eyes and ears of a patient and can relay important facts to the drs. 2 mins spent with a pt. is not enough time to get to know a pt. I was admitted to emerg 3 times and in the hosp 5 days before I was diagnosed with 5 questions. This is totally unacceptable. How many people die because they do not know enough to ask the right questions or request the right service to look at them. I consider myself to be very lucky and if I was not a XXXXX I probably would be dead. Nurses are not just someone to give out pills + do vitals They are they eyes, ears and voice which the drs. rely on. If they do not have the time to observe, and listen and speak to the dr. patients have no voice. Another joke is the call you receive the day after you go home. They ask if you made your (unreadable) to dr appointment & you say no they\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

E-mail: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX A brief chronological summary of related events follows - I had experienced several incidents of blood and clot sin my urine, and shortly before XXXXXXXXX was unable to urinate and went to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXXX has a limited urology department currently to be augmented in XXXX we understand). - A catheter was installed which relieved the problem for a few days, and incidentally I was told that I also had a hernia. - Our local doctor diagnosed a bladder infection and prescribed an antibiotic which I took for a week or so in addition to various blood and urine tests done at the nearby XXXXXXX laboratory. - Another blockage occurred which XXXXXXX was unable to clear and I was ambulanced to XXXXXX accompanied by a local nurse. After the urology resident was unable to insert a catheter in the E.R. I was admitted. Dr. XXXX installed a new catheter using a scope to avoid \"false passages\" and also a supra pubic catheter. After an overnight stay, he also ordered some x-rays and scans to be done in XXXXXXX. - We contacted the XXXX which sent out a home care helper via XXXXXXXX who provided and demonstrated the irrigation process using syringes and bags that we could attempt at home. On analyzing the scan results DR. XXXX referred me to Dr. XXXXX who determined that I had a tumor in my bladder and proposed a surgery to remove the bladder and prostate. He subsequently arranged for a hernia surgeon to repair that issue as well during the process and scheduled this for early XXXXX. - I've been home for a few weeks during which we picked up some supplies from the local XXXX to continue irrigations at when needed. A few more blood, urine, kidney tests have been done locally in this timeframe as requested by Dr XXXXX. - We appreciate the efficient transfers of data and history amongst the agencies and doctors involved, no doubt saving time and duplication for both the doctors and patients. - The only complaint that has surfaced involved contacting the local XXXX. At one point we had six phone numbers for various functions. On calling the one several times for what we understood to be the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, we were curtly asked if we had called the clinic and redirected with yet another (7th) phone number which we hadn't been given previously. Subsequent inquiries were successful in resolving this issue. We were issued a XXXX 6 panel tri-fold pamphlet for XXXXXXXXXXXXXX that includes numbers for XXXXXXXXXX, but not XXXXXXX. On this pamphlet there was a phone number missing one digit of the sequence. The discharge nurse at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX had to send a staff member on a search and find mission on XXXXXXXX who provided the XXXXXXX number to connect to the XXXX on a post-it note. - Your survey response is attached. We thought this summar might help clarify the sequence of events and co-ordination of the various participating health care entities. - With appreciation to all XXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

The process started off poorly. I had to call preadmission for the appt. because my urgent day surgery was coming up and I had not be given a date for pre-admission appt. The intake was awful. I was called in through some swinging doors, so I collected my coat and turned around to a closed door and no one. So I went through the doors hoping I might recognize the person who called for me. I am sure they are self aware, but I only saw them very briefly and not sure who to look for when entering through the swinging doors. A person was there with their back to me, no name given, no name badge, did not give me any designation on who they were, no hello, no eye contact and no answers when I asked if this person was the one who called me into the hallway. Told me to get on the scale prior to her making sure it was ready for me to do so. In fact I was on and off the scale four times because she was unable to write my weight down when using a pen on paper leaning on the wall. Now I am fit enough to do that, all I could think about, what if someone had mobility issues. And to top it off 'no-name' was upset with me she told me for the fourth time, for whatever reason, to get back on the scale. The scale gave her a number in kg which she assumed I needed to know in pounds. If asked I would have told her I don't need it in pounds. Simple communication. She faced the computer and asked me the usual questions, which was fine, but did not once look at me. She then said I needed bloodwork and when I asked why...she would not tell me. I had to ask again and then said it was because the surgeon asked for it. I said I had very recent bloodwork done a few weeks ago for a prior day surgery so I again inquired why I needed more done. She then was angry and said, 'so you are refusing blood work'. No, I just wanted to know why. Finally she explained after saying, do you want to know why, and in a patronizing tone, because you have had recent surgery and they want to see if there are any changes to your profile. That is all she had to say when I inquired the first time. Unfortunately, with that tone set and reticence to answer a simple and acceptable question I was not sure I should believe anything else she said. I was handed a booklet to read, with highlights, and told to wait for the medical doctor. A resident was the only one who actually looked at me during this whole interaction. I have been to all three hospitals in XXXXXX for very serious health issues. That pre-admission interview was awful. I am a very grounded individual and not easily put off or made to feel uncomfortable to the point of concern that my very serious but stable heart condition was not considered during this preliminary process. This survey was fortuitous because I was going to go to the patient ombudsman after I had somewhat healed from my surgery. Again, to make myself very clear. It would have been better if that process had been a phone interview. If I had to come from some distance and had little knowledge of the healthcare system I might not have come back for the surgery. I realize this sounds dramatic but it unfortunately it is truthful. My son was with me and he also found the process, in his words, 'why did we come here?'. Stark contrast to XXXXXXX and XX. I have had other tests and appts and XX. The process to get to the specialists at XX has been less than acceptable. Wrong name, (even after giving my health card), sent to wrong department, wrong tests prior to me speaking up, wrong medication to be started and only change after I spoke to my cardiac surgeon...having said that when I actual get to the specialist then I am well taken care of and feel I am in safe hands. Extremely siloed communication and apathy at integral steps in the process of healthcare. This rant might not be directly associated with your survey regarding my hospital stay, but it certainly has to so h me getting to that hospital stay. If I had not be well versed in hospital procedure than I am not sure I would have come, or would have come with added unnecessary trepidation from the pre admission appointment.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I would hear just outside my door 2 nurses who where just complaining about their job. Not once did they check on me so I was upset because nobody came to check to see if I needed anything to ask for a blanket and I was kinda of upset when I asked, or maybe more frustrated they didn't check on me. So the nurse commented that I was ungrateful could patient I did apologize, but she called the doctor to check in on me because of the way I was acting They don't know what I was feeling or going through. I was deprived of oxygen so made a comment like that, I was very disappointed. Maybe if they focused on the patient that were waiting and not complaining about their job maybe I would reacted differently. But I did apologize.

After our whole ordeal, I'm a little sickened that you've even asked - I've come to the realization that we're not alone in our mistreatment and lack of professionalism, compassion and understanding under the care of XXXX. My dad died XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 5 days after he was discharged from XXXX. It was late in the afternoon that XXXXXX that XXXXXXXX portered him home - late enough that we couldn't get our family doctor to the house until the following XXXXXX. My dad was admitted/discharged with the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. He was in so much pain, he couldn't sleep, talk or eat. All he could do was hold his leg in agony. The attending physicians sent him home with nothing to control his pain. They said because he couldn't clearly verbalize his pain level, they couldn't be certain he's in any pain at all. I've had never in my lifetime seen anyone in the amount of pain that my dad was experiencing. It was quite apparent to anyone who came around that he was in severe pain. But we were helpless until we could have a house call from our family doctor. Her residents came early XXXXXX. morning and couldn't believe what they were seeing. They said that my dad should not have been discharged in the state he was in. They couldn't understand why a doctor would let someone endure this level of torture. They reported back to our family doctor, she came as quick as she could on XXXXXX. By the time any pain medication made its way to our home, it was late XXXXXX night, around 11pm. This is now 6 days of no sleep for my dad while in tremendous pain. It tears me apart that we couldn't comfort him in his fight. He tried. He kept trying. Once he was administered his pain medication, my dad never woke again. Within 36 hours, he was gone. This was the ending to a hellish nightmare with XXXX. My dad suffered from dementia. Every time he had any dealings with XXXX, he was brushed under the rug because of the dementia. He was less of a person in the eyes of most of the staff there. No matter the issue that brought him into their care, their diagnosis always circled back to dementia. Give me a freaking break. Let's quickly touch on a few of the instances that cause me to believe that my dad wasn't ever given a fighting chance to survive while XXXX steered his ship. XXXXXXXXXXXX: my dad took one of those notorious midnight walks that dementia sufferers are known to do. An officer spotted him and quickly got medical attention for him. He was admitted with hypothermia. He wandered in his socks, he wandered so far that he wore holes through the pressure points in his socks. He was also diabetic. Foot injuries and diabetes are very serious. The ER department noted, even laughed and poked fun at the holes in his socks but didn't take any time to address his feet. They didn't clean them didn't bandage them... nothing. He was admitted for hypothermia, that's it, that's all. Guess what these blisters led to?! 12 months of every antibiotic under the sun. IV, oral, everything in between. XXXXXXXXXXXXX: Finally came an appointment with a geriatric specialist at XXXXXXXX. It's there we discovered that 2 of his medications were conflicting and made his memory impairment much worse along with increasing nerve pain that he had been suffering from for many years. Now we begin a very lengthy withdrawal of benzos. Each decrease in dosage scarier than the last. This took 7 or 8 months because hew as on such high doses of these drugs. We would see such great improvement in him in all ways, until the next drop. The withdrawing brain does such wild things when it's craving. Over the next several months my dad had many ups and downs with the withdrawal and antibiotic combo. He had nurses every day to administer thas a fall risk, they strapped him down by the wrists and hips. During one of our visits, early in his stay, he asked the nurse if he could go to the washroom. She told him to go in his underwear and someone will clean him up later. He insisted that it was a number 2 and he needed to go now. She replied that he needed the assistance of two nurses and there wasn't a second one available to help. She walked out of the room. Shortly thereafter, a catheter was inserted. I overheard this same nurse during a shift change that he pulled out his IV. She pulled out his IV when we asked her to untie him so we could help him eat. He wasn't untied from that bed for 32 days. He lost the ability to walk due to loss of muscle. He lost the ability to control his bladder. He lost his pride. He lost any independence that he had before this visit. They ignored him, they were rough with him, he had cuts and bruises with zero explanation - yet he was tied up all of the time? He wouldn't eat for them - he would just hide his head under the blankets or stare off into the TV. He would eat little bits for us - they thought he would do better at home. They started a \"return home plan\". They picked a time for a phone conference call with a nutritionist, social worker and the blue team resident. That resident wasted no time in telling my mom and I that my dad was at the end of his life, basically disregarded the importance of the future care plan for my day. My mom was devastated. This is the first time we ever heard anything of the sort. We thought he was doing better. We figured we could help him get strong at home where he was safe and comfortable. They promised physio, nutritional support, medical devices and more hours for PSWs and home assistance. They discharged him ona XXXXXXXX, on a XXXXXX, forgot to send in his prescriptions, forgot to send his referral back to XXXX... on a XXXXXX. At 4pm. He was happy to be home, but with his newest issue of not being able to walk, his regular bed wasn't going to work. We were lucky enough to be able to have a hospital bed delivered late that XXXXXX evening. He kept trying to walk, physio never ever showed up to assist in relearning how to walk. But he would brace himself down hallway and try his best. But it hurt. His legs would hurt really bad afterwards. He was so upset with the incontinence. He was mortified. We never did get any extra assistance. My mom, who is physically disabled, had to do nearly everything by herself - changing the bed sheets multiple times a day from accidents, lifting him and assisting him into the chair, feeding him, administering his medications. The PSWs that would come were not capable of caring for his needs. Many couldn't speak English, one was pregnant and couldn't lift him, others would be booked for 30 minutes, they'd come in, change his pull-up and leave. Many would cancel due to short staffing. Please don't get me wrong - we had a handful of amazing nurses and PSWs through XXXX. A couple of them were with us for nearly the whole year. They knew my dad, they knew our dynamic. They became family. They felt our fears and helped pull us through. But they can only come when they are scheduled, and they were so amazing that I'm sure other families felt the same way about them as we did. On XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, my dad was in a lot of pain. My mom had to pick him up and move him into his chair, he couldn't assist her in any way. He couldn't even speak. I came home at lunchtime and noticed that his right leg was white. So white. Terrifyingly white. A PSW had shown up around the same time as I did, and he had no idea what was happening so my mom made a call to our family doctor nurse practitioner. She suggested that my mom call an ambulance. Here we go again. XXXX did all their tests, some over a few days. He was diagnosed with Peripheral Arterial Disease, his arteries in his leg and hip were(Text Exceeds Field Length)Vs and clean the wound on his left foot. He had frequent visits to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for debridement of the wound. He was becoming weaker by the day. He was sick to his stomach all the time and was losing weight quickly. It was becoming very concerning that his medical professionals wouldn't address opposing issues - like the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX couldn't care less about the symptoms of withdrawal. The geriatric specialist didn't really give a care about all the intense antibiotics he was having to consume. Any time we would be concerned with his symptoms, it was always dementia that get accused. We would try to explain, we would try to get these doctors to understand all that he was coping with, but we were always just disregarded. XXXXXXXXXXX: My dad was sick to his stomach. He couldn't get much in his belly to calm the stomach irritation caused from the antibiotics. He was lightheaded and much more confused than usual. His toe was swollen, and the top of his foot was red. It hurt more than usual. He had a fall in the middle of the night, had a hard time getting up, my mom thought it was time to see a doctor, so she called an ambulance. We thought maybe he had a UTI wreaking havoc. My mom is always so proactive - she kept an updated list ready of all my dad's meds, duration and dosages, for each visit to a doctor so she had one ready to go with him to the ER. They didn't even bother reading it. They put him on all the exact same medication we had just weaned him off for 9 months. He had become fidgety, his pain in his back was a constant bother, he felt like he needed to crawl out of his skin. For this, they kept him restrained at the hips during the night. Just to be safe that he wouldn't become disoriented or fall over the IVs. He was scared. He was paranoid. But with us, he was in great spirits and couldn't wait to come home. Turns out the infection in his foot was now in his bone and that was causing the increased confusion and added foot pain and swelling. He seemed to be doing much better after his week-long stay. Plan of action was 57 days of this kick-in-the-nuts IV antibiotic along with an oral one. We were so happy to get him home. He was shaking from the stay. He had night terrors, kept thinking they were coming to get him. We figured it was from the medication  we were weaning him off of again. My mom promised him that she would never send him back there. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX: my dad was sick again. Worse this time. We watched this antibiotic sink its teeth into his entire being. He couldn't eat at all. Gagging at the thought of food. He was uneasy on his feet, his blood sugar dipping really low. He was trying so hard to follow our direction of trying to increase his blood sugar. He knew he was in a bad state. He was sleeping a lot, we figured it was the best way for him to heal. On the morning of XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, my mom found my dad on the hallway floor outside of the bathroom. He was mostly incoherent, there was a large pool of saliva around him. My mom called another ambulance. In the meantime, he had crawled his way back to his bedroom. He knew who we were, he knew he was headed to the hospital. With assistance from the paramedics, he walked his way out to the ambulance. He was in bad shape. We were, and still are, convinced the antibiotics ate him from the inside out. At this point he had been on antibiotics for 10 months. There is no way that there would be no serious repercussions for that length of time on such strong antibiotics. His veins were thin and caving in, they couldn't hold the IVs in place anymore. His Free Style Libre scanner couldn't even read his blood sugar because it was too low. He had barely eaten in weeks. He did not want to be poked and prodded, he was not happy. He was upset to be back in the hospital, he was not easy to get along with. His bloodwork showed that he was in hypoglycemic ketoacidosis and he had markers in his blood of a recent seizure.

More attention to basic needs like nutrition and hydration and answering that call bell without being told 'I'm not your nurse, she is busy/on break... I will tell her' only for nobody to follow up is not acceptable. Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was outstanding. Everyone else could use a bit more support to show they care. Also, the patient transport process to XXXXXXXXX in the middle of winter could be made more comfortable with attention from the nurse to dressing or suggesting coat, footwear for the ride over. The care at XXXXXXXXX cardiac cath lab team was outstanding. Maybe because there were 3 nurses to every bed.

I am very upset that I was sent there! I was almost the only person without COVID symptoms and had to sit with many people in close proximity who had symptoms.

I did not go to the emergency since I did not want to come in contact or close proximity with people with COVID. My family doctor sent me as an OUT PATIENT to get a CT-Scan, as I was still suffering from concussion symptoms. After the CT-scan, the technician took me to the door and said, to please follow the green line and go to emergency and then closed the door quickly  having another patient with her. I went to emergency and told them that I was an out patient and didn't think I should be there, but they said I should wait perhaps, something showed up on the CT-scan that needed immediate attention. I was then re-registered from out patient to emergency. When a nurse finally came to get me from the hall, I explained again, that I didn't think I should be there. I also explained it to the doctor. I was shunted for the next 4 hours from different examine rooms to different chairs. (I never saw any disinfectant used in the exam rooms or on the chairs.) I had my blood taken and an ECG, but never received the results of my CT-SCAN! After 4 hours in that department the doctor finally agreed to let me go home.

I know the staff were doing their due diligence since I had been sent there by the technician ... but why couldn't they have called the CT-scan department and double check that indeed I was sent to the emergency department or she accidentally confused who I was.

I did not anticipate a stay at the hospital, it was an emergency procedure. I found it helpful to watch the video in the hallway outside emerg. About 'triage'.  I noted that it said that some people may not look like as though they need urgent care, like someone having a heart attack or appendicitis but it could be serious.  I was certain that I had appendicitis as I sat and waited nervously to be seen. Once in one of the triage emerg. rooms I was told that I would have to have surgery and that it could happen that night. I was then told the surgeon wasn't coming in until the next day so I would have to wait. I was then brought to a stretcher in the 'emerge surge' I heard it called. The nurse that walked me there told the two nurses in that sec. that they needed to find me a space as they were very busy. The nurses told that nurse that they couldn't accept anymore patients. I felt like a bit of an inconvenience being present during that conversation. I was appreciative of the more 'private space'. The nurse there made me feel comfortable. I was informed that me room was ready upstairs but that they could not care for me there because there was a shortage of nurses. While in that space, I overheard staff telling off other staff for not following proper PPE procedures i.e. not changing their gown from patient to patient. I was wheeled to surgery and while looking up could see the rusty vents on the ceiling.  The nurses and doctors were very kind and thoughtful during surgery. Once in my room again the nurses were attentive. There was an empty IV bag in the washroom that remained there until I left. My surgery was around 2:00 on the XXXX - I was given a hamburger and a tea for dinner. Apparently my sister requested to be updated when my surgery was finished. I was asked what I wanted for breakfast, I told the staff. The next morning, after 10:30 am someone came to ask me what I wanted for my lunch - I mentioned that I hadn't had breakfast. I understood that my sister called around the same time for an update as no one had informed my family as to what was happening. Someone brought my breakfast to my room, apologized and said they heated up my breakfast. I later had my lunch brought to me. A nurse came in to wish me a happy birthday and said that the doctor is really busy in surgery today and because it's the weekend didn't know when the doctor would see me. My family was on hold as they originally understood that I would be released this day and they needed to plan to get me. The doctor then popped in to see me asked how I felt, said he was discharging me and that I needed to see him in a few weeks for a follow up. The nurse came in my room later and said that she is going on break and that the doctor may come when she is on break to discharge me. I said that he came in already, but I don't know if she heard me. I then figured maybe she was saying that the doctor was going to bring in the papers for discharge. The nurse came back with the papers and said that she didn't know that the doctor came to see me.  I am grateful for the health care providers and the work they do. I also appreciate how COVID has impacted the system.  I did not have the worst experience, but I know that it could have been better. I have many close friends and family that work in the health care system and understand the importance of patient care. I suggested that the best way of understanding how well a hospital or care it's providing is doing is to 'be a patient' - sit in emerg for over an hour, observe; lie on a stretcher in the emerge surge, listen; lie on a stretcher and go for a ride to surgery, look around and listen.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

From the point of doctor's of assessment the situation of the patient may not be always that much serious; but, that is obvious only after some tests are done. Furthermore, not all the patient come from a healthcare related background; even if so, the condition may be panicky if the symptoms are related to the heart, which is always an unpredictable organ, manifests acutely, may have a fatal outcome even from 'Acute Coronary Syndrome'; though finally often seen it was due to GERD. So, all these are the reasons to be scarred equally for layman, or anyone with healthcare background. At the time of presentation I think a positive concentration-interaction with the patient by a doctor would be very much helpful to alleviate the concern of the symptoms.   I guess the number of Emergency physicians are comparative less, remains busy going through computer networking to analyze; so, wouldn't have that much time to spare talking to a particular patient to  assure always. Some of the specialized tests 'stress test' for heart are advised to an outside clinic, far away. This is sometime thought as not in a positive way; should have any sort of specialized department with specialists, all relevant category of tests in the same regional hospital; that is often seen in a comparable level of hospital in a third-world country even, though they run in a private sector.  Finally to say, the overall service this hospital providing to all the patients are very much encouraging, improved a lot in the last 5-6 years, I see. Hope, the hospital would try to raise it's standard and satisfaction more and more in future. All the best.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

It was not normal, I am giving his soup and he was falling asleep as he is trying to eat.  His stool was completely black.  He had blood with stool.  They kept saying it is all normal and side effect of the antibiotic.

All I wanted some information as my brother-in-law is a doctor and I just wanted to show him the report so that he can try to help.  I have escalated with Dr. XXXXXXX to talk to the nephrologist.  Next day, the nurse called me confirming that my dad will be transferred to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX in XXXXXXXXXXXXX I still do not understand why hospital kept him if they did not treat for creatinine and actually made his condition worse.

I hope you take the time review my concerns and take necessary steps so that no other patients suffers how my father suffered.  My father XXXXXXXXXXX was admitted in XXX emergency in late XXXXXXX due to pain in his chest.  I would say the emergency service was good given the current COVID situation.  Since my father had a language barrier, the emergency was kind enough to let me be with him all day.  They decided to keep as they mentioned he need pacemaker.  From next day I could not get in even though I kept explaining them that he can't speak much English and is very nervous.  Still I thought it was ok as XXX is doing it everyone's safety.  Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX called me and asked me how my father's creatinine reached to 300 from 230 (a year ago.  But before I can explain anything he hung up.  Concern started from the day they took him to a XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for procedure.  He was supposed to have it in the morning but they did it in late afternoon.  After his procedure neither XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX nor XXX can tell me where he was.  At least the staff was nice to me when I was trying to locate him.  But someone name XXXX (I think she is a nurse) kept answering call when I kept calling as I was worried about my dad.  She was very rude telling me that it is very normal.  At the end my dad arrive back in XXX after 9:00 PM. No one still called me I had to keep calling and find out at the end.  XXX mentioned they will keep him for 3 days to monitor and will release him but after 3 days, they mentioned they are afraid he may have heart failure.  Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXX called and advised that my dad has some sort of bacteria in his stomach and she is prescribing an antibiotic to control it.  Since then his creatinine started to increase very fast and my dad's contrition kept getting really bad. My dad was getting frustrated and I kept asking to talk to Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX but never was able to reach him.  After 10 days they have allowed me to get in (many thanks to nurse XXXXXXX!)

Considering the excellent prenatal care I received in the hands of my OBGYN at XXXXXXXXXXX, I was shocked about what I experienced (my OBGYN was not the one to deliver my baby). I opted for an epidural during my labor and the nurse attending me completely ignored when I told her time and time again that my pain was not managed. I was experiencing excruciating back labor at the time. After reviewing nurse notes with my OBGYN afterwards it said I was coping with pain well. I WAS NOT! It wasn't until an anesthesiologist noticed I was pressing on the button to administer more epidural medicine non stop that I was listened to and administered the right dose of anesthesia. By then it had been going on for a few hours. I was supportive of a teaching hospital before, but my experience during labor was awful. I ok'd a resident to perform a vaginal exam, but little did I know that it would take much longer than usual, be painful and then be followed up by an exam by the OBGYN on the floor. I felt completely violated by the experience. During the C-section I mentioned feeling pain several times during the surgery, it was ignored and minimized. I felt faint like I was going to pass out, also ignored. Later I learned I had lost a lot of blood, but no one would tell me anything. Afterwards, I had severe anemia and it took days for doctors to come up with and execute a plan of care to resolve it. In the meantime I was receiving immense pressure to breastfeed even when I was unwell, dizzy and at risk for heart failure. There was even a nurse who cared for me during my stay that refused to set up a catheter for an IV blood transfusion. Apparently she had not put one in 15 years! It made her sick to do it and had the same reaction when she had to get blood from me. I cannot believe there was such incompetence. I plan on having a more through discussion about my stay with patient relations in person as soon as I get a copy of my complete medical records, as there are a lot more things that went wrong and honestly could talk about it for hours.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

After she had finished her extensive intake, the surgeon Dr. XXXXX, arrived with the resident Dr. XXXXXX. He inquired about what kind of anaesthesia I was going to be given, the anaesthesiologist informed him that I would be given a spinal block. He was visibly surprised and went on to argue why she would want to do this rather than a general anaesthetic. Surprisingly to me this went on for some time. The anaesthesiologist then went on to state that in case of a general anaesthetic she would have to put a heart line - this led to even more visible surprise from Dr. XXXXX and the argument continued. The anaesthesiologist held her ground and said this was necessary given my cardiac history combined with sleep apnea. At this point the Dr. XXXXX turned to me and asked me which of the options I would like. I have to say I was totally baffled witnessing this argument and was thrown off by being posed this question given that I had no expertise to base this choice on. Dr. XXXXXX, reminded me that in her briefing she had set that the choice of anaesthetic would be based on my discussion with the anaesthesiologist. I turned to the anaesthesiologist and said I would defer to her expertise. I was anxious about my surgery and this whole debate about what was appropriate for me between the two doctors who are going to conduct the surgery felt bizarre, surreal and quite inappropriate. The surgery proceeded with a spinal block; the OR nurse was extremely professional, compassionate and helped me come down enough to receive the spinal block. Pain management was controlled with Percoset every four hours until time of discharge.  Dr XXXXX reported to family with a puzzled expression, that he did see some infection and inflammation in the knee, but no structural damage, and some arthritic degeneration, but commensurate with age. He advised that Infectious Diseases would follow up with intravenous antibiotics based on what the cultures showed and that this could be a 4- 6 week at home care protocol. XXXXXX Dr. XXXXXX handed the case back to Dr. XXXXXX who told me that given that cultures remained negative that this was a likely case of pseudo-gout, regardless of the fact that there were no crystals. I was put on iv drip broad spectrum antibiotic for six days. Pain and inflammation remained high throughout the six days with persistent low-grade fevers and sweats, temperature recorded between 37.1-38.2C XXXXXX I was told by Dr. XXXXXX that I had pseudo-gout, but Rheumotology contradicts this diagnosis as no crystals are visible from the aspiration or fluid removed during surgery. Physiotherapy came and instructed on proper use of crutches and stepping up and down stairs. They encouraged me to move as much as possible and increase weight on the leg as I could tolerate XXXXXX Infectious Disease Resident, Dr. XXXXXX confirmed that my condition was septic arthritis and that the knee has changed little since surgery. Rheumatologist Dr. XXXXXXX came with a number of residents to review my case. He had concerns when I reported that I had had back pain in the weeks leading up to this acute condition. He suggested that this could indicate inflammatory arthritis, and x- rays were ordered for lower-back that evening.  Rheumatology residents performed a second aspiration to relieve some of the swelling - it was visibly mostly blood that was aspirated. Dr. XXXXXX of Infectious Disease came with Dr. XXXXXX prior to the x-ray and said that they were not going to put a PIC line in for intravenous antibiotics, instead were going to put me on a combination two antibiotics that were effective orally: doxycycline and doxycycline for two weeks. XXXXXX Infectious Disease came - I complained about the conflicting diagnoses, and I had not heard back from Rheumatology re the x-s regarding inflammatory arthritis. I was deeply anxious. I was told I would be discharged that day.  Rheumatology came, Dr. XXXXX - nothing was found to indicate inflammatory arthritis and no gout or pseudo-gout; the aspiration showed no positive results in the cultures and the WBC had dropped from 53000 to 43000.

I have an amazing, amazing doctor and her immediate team is exceptional. I have now had two surgeries in this hospital and have had day sessions such as X ray etc and the staff and the services I have received are phenomenal. My only concern was that on the night of my surgery, i.e. XXXXXXXXX, I only got to my room at 10.30 pm because there was no bed up until that time, despite having signed and paid for a semi-private room since morning. I did not mind staying in the Post-Op. The staff there were taking very, very good care of me. There was a lot miscommunication - first the bed wasn't there, then the room wasn't clean then I was told that because I only 'woke up' at 4 pm, my bed was delayed. The lady next to me in the Semi-Private room later told me that the room and bed were vacant since she had arrived the night before. Later that night, I was told by the nurse who was attending to me that she was only 'part-time' and had quite a number of patients so she would get to me when she could. The lady who was sharing the room with me was in extreme pain - hip replacement - because as it was later discovered, her wound had become infected. Her catheter was removed but she was still generating a lot of urine and the bed pan could not contain it. She kept asking the nurse to put her on catheter because the pain in her leg made it impossible for her to go to the bathroom. She was XX years old. In the middle of the night, I pressed the bell several times to get the nurse into the room. The same nurse forgot to order my breakfast. The day nurse jammed the blood thinner into my arm and I had a bruise for several weeks. It was only when my doctor came to see me at about 10.30 am that I finally got something to eat and the day nurse seemed very displeased about the doctor's involvement. The nurse that attended to me the following night was a true professional; empathetic, and completely attentive. It made me feel a lot better. There was a lot of ambient noise and I think there was no a/c. The bathroom only got cleaned when I was leaving on the XXth. The supplies were on bare minimum. I had brought my own stuff so I did not need anything. The lady next door had accidents in the bathroom so it was unpleasant to use the soiled bathroom everyday. XXXXXXXXX is a great hospital. The doctors there - the ones I saw and dealt with on several occasions - are extremely committed towards their patients. In the Post-Op, the staff were truly exceptional. I was treated so very well. And the follow-ups by the doctors were very, very thorough. Often times, it is the little things that stain one's experience. In my case, the nurse telling me that she had too much on her hands got me extremely worried of the kind of service I would receive in the next few days. I was stressed the entire night and the next day. Then the following evening became more manageable because the nurse who came on duty that night made me feel very comfortable. I did not need that much attention except when I had an accident with my tea. I never took the pain pump and I did not need help getting into the bathroom but I kept thinking of those who might have needed help and were compromised because a part-time staff had a load of patients. I wanted to thank XXXXXXXXX and its staff for taking good care of me while I was there. I would still go to your hospital in the future. I think that in Canada we are quite blessed to have such sophisticated healthcare facilities and dedicated healthcare professionals.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

While the care was excellent, there were a few difficulties with settling in when admitted. At first I was told I would be in ICU for the night. It turns out ICU was full so I was admitted, but a regular room was not available. I stayed in a room in the Emergency Department, which does not have a washroom in the room. I did not have a pillow. The nurse tried to find one, but could not. I asked if I could get something to eat at around 9:00 pm. It arrived at 11:00 pm. I was brought to a hospital room the next afternoon which was on rather than the Cardiology floor, which is where I was told I would go. I arrived in the room after the last meal was served, but I needed something to eat. I asked for a vegetarian meal. I was told they would see what they could do. I inquired a couple of times after about an hour and was told the order was resubmitted twice. After another 15 minutes went by a meal arrived. After 10 more minutes a second meal arrived. After about 10 more minutes a third meal arrived. I had plenty to eat! I realize I entered Emergency on one of the busiest days during the year ... the day after a long weekend. So taking that into account, you should know all staff members did the best they could to keep me comfortable and follow up on my requests. All tests and procedures were performed as planned and results were communicated to me very quickly. Nurses in Emergency and in the hospital were excellent. The Emergency doctors were excellent. I am fortunate to have Dr. XXXX assigned as my Cardiologist. She is very refreshing, being open, honest and highly accomplished in her field. I am thankful for the good care I received. I tell you about the the few missteps described above in case you would like to know.

He prescribed omeprazole for my acid and I was on my way, completely exhausted, dizzy and traumatized by my experience altogether.My experience was absolutely horrendous, I came in for acid reflux pain that was not allowing me to keep my food down, and I had extreme discomfort in my stomach. Right away I was met by a nurse and a student who asked if it was okay to ask me questions prior to meeting the doctor. I answered all her questions and the nurse did a blood test. I immediately informed the nurse about my stomach pain and she said she would talk to the doctor but as an hour went by, I did not see her again, so I asked the student if she could find the nurse or the doctor because I was in a lot of pain, the student then proceeded to tell me she would inform the doctor. 2 hours later so now a total of 3 hours I finally see the doctor and he asks me the same questions the student asked. From there I explained how severe the pain was and he completely ignored me and with his back facing me said I don't think you need an ultrasound I'll be back. He then closed my door and in front of my room spoke to the student saying 'this is probably a case of anorexia, where she is making herself throw up, you know how thew are, just leave her in there for a bit longer'. I was completely mortified, how dare he first off racially profile me with the assumption that I am which I am not, and then go to associate being with having an eating disorder WHICH I DO NOT, all in front of my room where I could openly hear him. 2 more hours went by and at this point my stomach pain is excruciating a solid 10. So I step out of my room and request someone grab the doctor, he comes into my room and I tell him I am in more pain than when I arrived. He then proceeds to say that he wants to get an ultrasound for me now and can see that I have gone pale from the pain so that he was gonna get a nurse to administer pain meds, I explain that I have had morphine a few years ago when I visited an ER because they thought I had appendicitis and that it was a little too strong for me he says okay and a nurse comes in and gives me HYDROMORPHONE!!! She doesn't even tell me what she is giving me instead she just says its a light pain reliever, within 1 minute I had gotten nauseous and dizzy and needed to lay down on the bed because I felt as though I was going to pass out. SHE THEN PROCEEDS TO MAKE ME GET UP even though I explained I felt as if I was going to go pass out, and to go sit on the chairs outside of the individual rooms because she wanted to use my room for someone else and then she disappears. At this point I am sweating I have restricted breathing because I am wearing a medical mask due to the pandemic I am having extreme heart palpitations and I literally felt myself going in and out of consciousness in the middle of the ER on a chair. I wake up crying and ask a random nurse if I can have something for the nausea because I cannot even stand nor find and see my own nurse or doctor. He then proceeds to say I cant find your doctor so here smell these alcohol toilettes and chew on these ice chips. 15 minutes later I am still sweating profusely and shaking uncontrollably and my nurse comes and says wow you are REALLY naive and weak here is some gravel and then gives me gravel intravenously. I tell her that I need to lay down and so she puts me in a bed out in the hall because she kicked me out of my room as I was mid conscious. I genuinely didn't think my experience could get any worse but I found myself waiting and hallucinating at this point until 2 pm for my ultrasound and I had gotten to the ER at 3 am. I asked my nurse when it would be my turn seeing as a guy who came in an hour ago was already being sent to his ultrasound and I had been there for 13 hours, that's when the nurse finally went to check. I was then approached by the shift changed ER doctor. He apologized to me saying the doctor in the previous shift or nurse made a mistake and never scheduled an ultrasound for me so I had just waited for no reason.

It wasn't until my husband went looking for someone at 23:30 that they finally came. 2) the anaesthesia team wanted to place an arterial line prior to my c-section. However, it took the fellow 11 attempts (5 in the left radial artery, 3 in the left ulnar artery, and 3 in the right radial artery) and 1hr 45min before she called her staff to place the line for her. 3) Our son lost >10% of his weight in the first 48 hours and, while we were told this was 'concerning', no one came to examine him / repeat bilirubin or other bloodwork. We were simply sent to the breastfeeding class (despite there being no concerns about my breastfeeding) and then discharged, without even a newborn discharge exam being completed. There was also no follow up plan regarding this. 4) I was also discharged from hospital prior to being seen by a physician. The nursing staff also asked my husband to sign our papers without reading through them, because she said he could 'sign now and read them at home'. 5) After we signed the discharge paperwork and were packing to leave, one of the OB fellows came to write a discharge prescription. He asked how I tolerated hydromorphone, which I hadn't taken at all for post operative pain. He then offered to write a discharge prescription for the hydromorphone, which I said I didn't want. And then he wrote a prescription for HM, anyway. I find this particularly concerning because I am opioid naive, was given a decent dose, and he did not provide any teaching on narcotics, at all, prior to sending me home with the prescription. 6) I was not given adequate discharge teaching on post operative recovery. 7) I was a patient at XXXXXXXXX specifically because I have a heart condition but, not once during my hospital stay, was I assessed by a cardiologist (or by anyone) to check for pedal edema / plural effusion / other signs of fluid overload. I was placed on telemetry for 36hr but no one ever spoke to us about these results. 8) none of our health care team seemed to be up to date on my medical chart and we were repeatedly asked questions about what care we had or had not received (if I had had my Rhogam already, if our son had had his hearing screen, who my family doc was, etc).\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Once again- we had some excellent nurses and doctors who were very diligent with their care. However, there was plenty of turnover on the postpartum floor and the ball was dropped. I returned home with not enough information to properly care for my condition. Luckily I have resources at my finger tips and was able to get by. Not everyone has this type of support though. Although I have high regard for certain doctors and nurses who cared for me, I was very disappointed in XXXXXXXXXXX overall.My labor experience with my nurse was excellent- I had one primary nurse the majority of the time, and she was very thorough and considerate with her care. During the delivery there was a team of doctors (resident, fellow, med student, nurses). I expected this and was fine with the number of people, however it was evident to my husband and me that the team was not all on the same page. The fellow did not seem to support the assessments and decisions of the resident (resident was taking lead), and there was quite a bit of back and forth to decide on a course of action. As a patient, it was unsettling to pick up on the negative feelings between doctors. I could tell that one doctor did not support the decision of another- this did not give me confidence. My baby had to be vacuumed, which resulted in a bad hematoma. I know this is a condition that can occur with vacuuming, but on the postpartum floor I had 3 different doctors and nurses make comments that the hematoma did not look good, and 'someone should have a talk with that doctor'. Based on family members who are L&D nurses, I have learnt that some hematomas can be avoid or the severity reduced based on the care of the doctor (removing the vacuum in between contractions). From the reactions of the XXXXXXXXXXX staff in the postpartum floor, I am assuming that the doctor that night was not careful enough. I sustained severe tearing during the delivery. The lead doctor (resident) briefed me on the tear just after my baby was delivered. I took in half the information because I was still in a state of shock from the arrival of my baby, and I assumed that surely that was not going to be the only time I was given information about my condition. Unfortunately that was the case- I was in the hospital about 48 hours after giving birth and no one fully briefed me on the type of tear nor provided thorough care instructions. A nurse did show my house to use the peri bottle and ice the area for 24 hours, but no instructions were given about mobility, signs to watch for, or guidance for a proper recovery. Another women on the postpartum floor had a severe tear as well and her doctors and nurses provided much more guidance- she encouraged me to ask about sitz baths, a sitting ring, and side-lying breast feeding. It seems our care varied drastically. On the post partum floor I had a few different nurses. Some were excellent, but two were did the bare minimum. Unfortunately the latter two were taking care of me during key moments- my arrival on the floor and my last morning. On my last day I had to ask for a sitz bath and then had to follow up to get instructions. I was in significant discomfort, and although meds were provided I was not given any information about what to expect when returning home. Luckily I have close family and friends who are doctors and L&D nurses so I was able to get proper support. However I should point out that my support people were shocked that I was given so little care in terms of my tears. I was part of the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX due to a blood condition. My team was given direction that once bleeding had stopped after delivery that I needed blood thinners 4-6 hours afterwards. Directly after my birth I had significant bleeding- even after I was stitched up. The resident was concerned, and then found out that a section was overlooked (with the amount of swelling, I'm sure this occurs often). However after the 2nd round of stitching I was still bleeding- my nurse kept a close eye on me, but the doctor never returned. No one looked at my tear after that point- not on the\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

In the following half an hr. I waited - but no water. My thirst kept increasing. Then . came to me to take blood. Immediately, I asked him to bring me water. He got upset and said, how do you dare to ask me, when you didn't even introduce yourself ..., I am not your servant\" I tried to explain to him why etc. and as he got more vehement, a verbal fight followed. Finally he tried to take blood, but didn't make it (all my vanes were dried out due to being dehydration.) Three more technicians came, each hunting for vanes under the skin, before they had enough blood. My hands were all blue as a result. It could've been a vindication, but the right procedure, in my case at least, should have been: - bring me water - let me rest a few hours to hydrate - use a hot-water pad on the wrists. 2) CT - x-ray Excruciating pain when attendant put in the dye (I've fibromyalgia, and it should be on the computerized records) I screamed loud. Then she stopped - did something before continuing. This results in much less pain. Is this a case of negligence, or fault with procedures? 3) Moving to a higher floor for the night. Many students dr's came asking me the same questions (N 5 or 6) One of them took an hr. as I also have a hearing - impairment I asked each one to order me slipping pills - each promised - but didn't do a thing. I also asked the 2 night nurses; they too promised but didn't act on it. The reason for these lies is probably to keep me awake so more students could come during the night. One only came, asked about 7 - 8 questions. (Middle of the night). She too promised sleeping pill, but none was delivered to the nurses. I couldn't sleep 1 minute all night long, which considering my condition a med. history amounts to an attack on my health, instead of remedy. Credits for student drs' and the 24 hrs long utilization of test equipment seems to be more important to the hospital, than the health & recovery of patients. A shame! Masks at the MR Early in the morning they took me to the MR. (2nd day) The warning of masks was mandatory there. Due to the total lack of sleep the night before I felt a meat-ball like thing in my throat and my nostrils were fully blocked (swelling) I could breathe through a wide-open mouth. There was no question I could ware a mask. I told the nurse - nevertheless they've found me a shield and she pushed me to the MR area. When she stopped the cart, I've continued the feeling that it was still moving and that it went through a tunnel made of white plastic - crossing the walls back + forth etc. When I told about it to the \"pushing nurse\", she said; don't close your eyes\" This after a sleepless night; and my complaint was dismissed for good! No follow-up! As I couldn't ware a mask the nurse attending to the MR sent me back to the emergency dept. Transfer to in-patient area. No one told me the reason why to transfer but the receiving nurse was friendly + professional. It turned out they ordered me a nose - spray, so I could go back to the MR. But when? The spray didn't arrive (at least while I stayed there!) After waiting for long hours for my turn to the MR, the idea occurred to me that my turn could very well fall to the middle of night. I spoke to the lady dr. attending the floor of late evening, and asked her to make a special appointment for me at the MR before the night begins, due to my advanced age (XX yrs) and condition. She said no way this could be done, this being a 24 hrs/day hospital. No exceptions! My decision to leave the hospital by this time (late evening) I decided to go home, as in now way I would survive a 2nd sleepiness night. I felt worse, over-all, than when entering the hospital. In this condition and in my age, I am certainwould've got a stroke, or heart attack, or fainting, if I stayed. If I was told about the uncertainty of the timing of MR scheduling, before the transfer, I would've gone home right from the emergency. The floor dr. was surprised at my decision, at first, as I was still dizzy, but I convinced her that I was at the very edge of my endurance, and had no other alternatives, but to leave at once. She agreed and they got me a push chair\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

I went in for chronic back pain nausea and headaches. I have damaged spinal issues spinal stenosis herniated discs and I?ve had multiple head injuries being over 10. The nurses ridiculed me and picked on me asking me about hepatitis C and every other sexually transmitted disease you could think of each time I went to the hospital I was put into a psychiatric assessment room. I have heart disease and lung COPD this was disregarded. And was part of tarsal to the purpose I was there. I fell a few times in my driveway and needed Medical Care but was ridiculed and picked on or ignored until I left. At one point I made a nurse aware while I was in a psychiatric care room. That I had extreme post traumatic stress and I was uncomfortable with her yelling at me because she was. She didn?t yell at me more and told me to stop looking at the floor. I told her I was looking at the floor to be non confrontational. She said you better look me in the eye when I?m talking to you. And continue to yell at me. I asked to be put in a room with a camera she said there was a camera there. I left and made a complaint to administration. XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. I was told the camera was never on. The nurse was excuse for her behavior and it was put off as my wrongdoing. I attended my doctor?s office who also asked if it was my wrongdoing. Advise them that the nurses were treating me poorly and yelling at me specifically one in particular that was most bad about it. My doctor said well there?s more of them than you with the same story. A XX year old lady in my doctor?s office stood up and interrupted. My doctor said I?ll be with you soon it?s not your turn. The woman said it?s not about my visit it?s about this gentleman. The woman who said that she was also yelled at and treated poorly at this hospital by a female nurse. I was told by XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX they were putting a warning on my chart that I would have freaked out if nobody approached me kindly. Because of my PTSD. When I returned to the hospital I was treated with respect and dignity by the doctors and nurses that treated me. I asked the doctor if he was treated me differently because of the warning on my file. He said no I treated everybody with respect. I said that's what I expected and I understand. I believe that I?m being marked to protect a woman who is treating other patients poorly and harassing them. I then heard the woman screaming in the background the nurse yelling at a different patient. The doctor had to go over and caution her not to yell at patients or treat them like that. I returned to the office to make another complaint about the nurses behavior and I was told that the issue was dealt with. That if I had an issue I would have to call ahead and make an appointment because I was disruptive and a pain. This administration is covering up for a nurse who is abusing patients. At the cost of my reputation and healthcare. On two of the occasions I attended the hospital I was having severe breathing problems fluid build up in my lungs exasperated COPD. On another occasion I had fallen in my driveway on my tailbone head and neck. I have problems with my spine and received whiplash and other issues from the fall including weakness in my hand and legs stumbling and falling loss of balance vomiting and headaches. I was treated like I was just some drug seeker. Left in a corner until I got up and left. The treatment that I received prior to the doctor that did help me was a 0 on all levels of courtesy, consistency or professionalism. In fact it affected my health in a absolute negative way. Where buy when I came home I choked and coughed and was coughing up so much fluid and mucus through my nose throat and lungs that I couldn?t breath. And each time that I breath in I was sucking the mucus back into my lungs. And I literally thou I was going to die in my bathroom. My treatment was so bad at the hospital that I was afraid to go there. For fear of them calling the police on me as they did on one occasion or making up an incident that never occurred. To protect one of their own from any penalization for their borderline criminal behavior. I suffered for almost 6 months with health problems unattended to on an emergency basis because of the threat and harassment I felt form this hospital. Once I did see a doctor he was fantastic my needs were met and taken care of CT?s and x-rays were done problems were found except for my lower spy the CT show that there were no problems when in fact there is problems I attended XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX on two or three different occasions where they discovered spinal stenosis herniated discs in a fracture to a spinal process. In fact I was so upset I wanted to make a complaint about the hospital to the professional institution that oversees it. But give ministration refused to give me the name of the nurse refused to refer me to any place that I make complaints to and refuse me any sort of resolution of help of any sort. The security officer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX involved himself directly in my healthcare. They stated that there was no caution on my file. And then later to protect themselves they stated that there was a caution at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX which made a caution at their hospital. Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXX kept referring to absolute fact about my medical file suggested that I take certain medications suggesting that I should take his medical advice. When I asked why he was giving me medical advice he denied that he was giving me any medical advice this is in fact was done so in front of a government employee who is drives me from appointment to employment. I had him on speakerphone. I advise Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXX that I did not want to speak to him in person because of his harassing nature. Big that I have post traumatic stress disorder. I suggested any and all of our conversations be through written correspondence because of his harassment any interference with my medical care. And given the idea that he kept revisiting the same issue trying to walk me in circles and upset me intentionally. He agreed the phone was ended. When I did show up at the hospital for emergency care I called XXXXXXX to speak to her about the results of the nurse and the idea that I was in the emergency and the nurse was actually yelling at other patients. When XXXXXXX attended my bedside which was something we agreed wasn?t going to happen that we would have her conversations on phone or through written correspondence. She brought XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with her. These two professionals kept walking me in circles and revisiting the same subject over and over again in an effort to try and upset me to deer the balance of blame to my condition as opposed to the behavior of the medical staff. My injuries are spinal one of the issues that I have is shaking. I advised him that the shaking was part of a spinal condition and epilepsy or seizure related to cervical logical damage. After several requested for them to leave the area and correspond with me through writing r on phone they did not leave. This took about 15 minutes finally they left. My overall experience at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was terrible. The only people that treated me with respect and dignity with the doctor himself in the final two nurses. Before this occasion I was terrified to return the hospital for any care for fear of being arrested. As on my first visit not only was I picked on and ridicules asked about sexual disease and harassed. Nobody would tell me where I could make a complaint and when I finally left a very large 270 lb security guard phone XXXXXX on me and later that OPP officer stop me downtown and harass me saying that I was being investigated for suspicious behavior. Therefore overall outside of the last two visits my treatment at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs terrible I was traumatized by my experience and I was afraid to return.

From attachment - Re : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Sypnopsis of events, XXXXXXX - XXXXXXXXXX - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX Transported to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX by ambulance to emergency with breathing problems. Spent day in department - not pleasant, it is what it is. XXXXXXX Depart Emergency, moved up to 3rd floor. The events which surfaced by hospital personnel resulted in a series of misadventures, severely mismanaged. A temporary space in a ward of six patients was set u with bed, a privacy divider adjacent to window area. It was not a room, but compared tot eh previous day at emergency, I could endure this situation. Unprovoked, my supper was rudely interrupted by the in-charge nurse who swiped my food tray and left. I was AGHAST. Apparently this person ordered two assistant nurses to dispose of the bed, divider and clear the area. My fifteen minute occupancy terminated. Considering, I had not eaten for two days of which somebody neglected to chart me on the food list, this aggressive act was conduct unbecoming a person of authority in the medical field. Eventually the area was reconstructed for another patient. I was prepared to proceed to the emergency dept. to inquire on room availability options. I entered a washroom to relieve my bladder. I was alarmed to hear people knocking on the door. There stood four top heavy security personnel. I was then ushered to the station and then directed back to the same ward. I spent the entire time, sleepless in a chair and under guard. My thought at the time was to request the presence of Dr. XXXXXXX. XXXXXXX spoke to me briefly and proceeded to investigate the circumstances with the 3rd floor director. Returning, he did not elaborate on is discussion with the security guards or the nursing director. On spending approximately twenty-five minutes with them, he informs me if he does not get home (it was supper hour) \"his wife would kill him\". It was evident Dr. XXXXXXX was not interested in any further conversation with me. I was placed under close custody, which remained 'till released on XXXXXXXXXX. Close custody is a term which equates with \"house-arrest\". On XXXXXXXXXX, I was moved to room XXXX on same 3rd floor. I have no recollection of this as I was administered a drug. With two heart attacks, XX years of age, in ill health, accompanied by security guards - \"WHY WAS THIS NECESSARY\"? I threatened no hospital personnel. In fact I have a great deal of empathy for nurses, who never stop during their very busy, overworked schedule. Being drugged by a controlled substance to any senior patient with heart issues could be fatal, relevantly in this case, totally unnecessary and unwarranted whichever bran LASIX ASAPAN or ATIVAN. Who ordered this pill to be administered? Without doubt, I suffered from a neck injury during room transfer resulting in severe splitting headaches and pain. I was later informed my head was left dangling off the bed, with no attention heeded to patient during procedure. It was during my emergence back to reality, after mumbling to putting grease in a pan if you were frying bacon. This was in response to my sister's call from XXXXXXXXXXX. She immediately suspected a serious utterance of an incoherent person, her brother. The restraint on my freedom of movement became problematic as my exercise program was curtailed. One foot beyond the threshold of my door would warrant the arrival of Regional Police. The person who caused this entire episode of events was the 3rd floor supervisor by the name of \"XXXXXX\". Social interaction can be a contentious forbearance of misfortune when English is not a person's first language. Her conduct warrants further action beyond \"performance review\". With an exuberance of authority the situation had evolved into a repulsive ironment I personally heard this person refer to my character as one fighting with staff and has mental problems to an incoming shift nurse. Of course, this was untrue. Her comments have left its mark in vengeful fashion towards me. Where was Dr. XXXXXXX during this turmoil? He issued a directive under form 42 of the mental health act to restrict my departure from this institution was inexcusable. \"THEN HE LEFT THE SITE FOR A WEEK'S HOLIDAYS\" The fall-out remained for others to proceed under the guise of \"DAMAGE-CONTROL\". A series of interviews were conducted by hospital personnel, whom I suspected were now engaged in psychological and psychoanalysis review which also extended to family members in XXXXXXXXXXX. As a voluntary or informal patient, the mental health act does not authorize a psychiatric facility to detain or restrain me. I noted the use of physical restraint has ethical, legal and clinical consequences It violates a resident's right to freedom, dignity and self-esteem. In a recent hospital-patient report, it was disclosed 1 in 18 hospital patients end up with some kind of harm not related to their condition. Requested : name of doctors of my case on discharge, representatives, witnesses, complete medical file, copies of all relevant material. The legalities of form 42 of the mental health act will be vigorously pursued in a venue of factual elements to be determined.

I wanted to explain to the people responsible for operating the hospital some of our concerns. This incidence has happened more than once on each occasion we have been at this hospital and now as a fmaily we think this should be told to someone so that corrections can be made in the system. On the last time we were there my dad spent almost two hours waiting in the ambulance bay to be seen. My dad was on blood thinners and he was bleeding out from his rectum. We were not allowed to see him in that time period, but finally after asking about him every half hour he was put in a curtained area and seen by doctor. The doctor decided to give him a full blood transfusion protocol in another area where there were lights and other machines after they ahd to move a patient out of that area and into the hallway of the ER. This was after the doctor asked us his wishes about DNR and we told him to do everything they can to save him. Blood bank notified and wheeled up a cart load of blood for dad as he had lost so much blood and his BP was unsafe. They were working on dad and two other surgeons were outside of the room talking with us stating a male at age XX would be hard pressed to undergo such a difficult surgery to the bowel if they had to remove it at that age. We were discouraged by the prognosis so far and in fear. The decision to move dad to ICU was made after his BP stabilized a bit after they finished giving him blood and platelets. The ICU area was another world up there, one on one service, very knowledgeable and caring. We saw him through the night and the next day saw two other doctors, which were stating that dad has cancer, 99 percent sure that the mass they saw by the radiologist test was cancer. We told them to just stop bleeding and we would deal with the cancer later. They planned to do an embolization and we signed the paperwork necessary and procedure started, but found out later by the gastroenterologists that the bleeding stopped on its own and he was able to see a bit that dad had pockets on his bowel and called it diverticulosis. This was good news as it was not cancer as he had a piece tested. So that blew the previous doctors diagnosis out of the water. Not sure why they even came to tell us the cancer thing until they had a biopsy results in hand? It's absurd if you ask us. Why worry a family unnecessarily? Soon after that dad was moved out of ICU with his neck port still in and catheter still on also. Dad got the delirium that most patients do get and when he was better we pushed to get him released out of the hospital. After eight days in he was finally home. We now wait for followup with the specialist and keep an eye on him that he doesn't bleed like that again. Two years prior to this incident dad ended up in ER again, because his throat was closing up and he couldn't drink a drop of water. We waited the usual long time to get him into an area and finally seen by a wonderful ears, nose, and throat specialist in the ER to diagnose his condition as being an allergic reaction to his pills. In the meantime we went through strange, but unusual circumstances of having another patient next to our curtained room throwing up all over and seeing the police as she was a drug addict who was allegedly raped whispering and moaning to the police about her incident. We finally were moved to another real room in where a note was slapped on the door stating we were under quarantine and had to gown up news to us and our doctor that was looking after dad. The infectious disease department put on our door and never bothered to tell us or the doctor. We were sitting righn the room and no one told us? This time dad ended up three weeks in the hospital, which I think was truly unnecessary to straighten out his meds as both the internist and the ear, nose, and throat specialist disagreed on his type of meds he was on. In turn dad lost his ability to walk in that time and it took him a long time after that long stay in hospital to get back to where he was before being admitted. So the morale of this factual story is: 1. Why are people staying so long in ambulance bays tying up the paramedics? 2. Why is the admission to the hospital so complicated and disorganized? 3. Why is the ER so short staffed and poor services in this department? 4. Why is there not enough room in ER for being a new hospital not handling the people? 5. Why do doctors tell you a diagnosis with no definite proof? We are very concerned with our health care system and haven't heard very much good news about the new hospital in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The ER department is ridiculous. ICU is fantastic. Regular floors are okay. If there is any other information you need please contact our family.

They wanted me to give my opinion on my experience in emergency triage and my stay in the hospital in order to better serve us. I felt that what happened while in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX cannot be said (on a scale of 1-10) response. I decided to call and speak to Dr. XXXXXXXXXX. I spoke with the secretary of the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. She said Dr. XXXXXXX no longer held that post. She asked if she could help. I gave her a bit of a rundown of my concerns. She said that she would relay my concerns with whomever was in charge and would get back to me if they wanted to know more or speak with me in person. I told her that I would be willing to go and discuss with them anytime at their convenience or over the phone. I believe that what I have to say is important and lifesaving, no longer for myself, but for those with heart disease after me. When the secretary returned my call and related what was said of my concerns it upset and annoyed me. I felt that the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX was on the defensive and did not understand why I had called. At this time of writing I am healing from open heart surgery. I had 90% blockage in 3 of my major arteries as well as 50-70% in others. I do not need to bother myself with patients that will go behind me but I want to... it is life and death important. If suing is in your thought, that is not even on the table. I am a Christian and would never even think of that. On the contrary, my experience in triage and emerg needs some changes. When my husband and I came to the emerge in XXXXXXXXXXXXXX on the XXXXXXXXXXX. at approximately 2: -2:30 P, we went to the Start Here Window. When the women asked my symptoms which she obviously could see, I was shaking, I told her I was lacking oxygen and the tightening of my chest. I was told to go sit down and wait for my name to be called. We waited for best of my recollection over 1/12-2 hours to simply get a blood test. I mentioned that my family history were that of clotters and I was very concerned about my condition and stroking. I asked her to please add this to my blood work. She did not take heed to this. While sitting amongst patients with flu, broken or sprained wrist, cuts etc. we waited for over 4 hours to see a doctor. Some, that had come in after me were called before me, in particular this young woman with a wrist problem, eating, laughing and talking quite loudly, as if nothing was really wrong. Once in, we still waited for over an hour... when I was finally seen by an RN or dr. I'm not sure... she said that in her experience I was a classic case of an angina sufferer and was preparing to send me home. I wanted to know how my blood clot test came out, she sent for a test, because the tech had not tested for that. Waiting again, it finally came back as being slightly elevated so for precaution she sent me for a CT scan. On my way back to emerg from the CT scan, I had an episode, difficulty breathing, shaking, chest tightening. My blood pressure was very elevated and the nurse quickly went to warn the dr. or RN taking care of me. she called up to the cardio floor to see if any cardiologist would still be there. Dr. XXXXXXX, the best I could have asked for, came down after he had finished with his patient. Even though all had calmed down again, this amazing dr. knew I was critical and he told me that I must stay in the hospital and he would schedule me for an angiogram at the beginning of the week. I was immediately put on blood thinners and heart monitor. It felt so good and peaceful knowing I was getting the help I needed. When someone that is XX, has difficulty breathing, chest tightening, shaking... obvious symptom sof heart disease, would it not be advisable to triage them through before cuts, flu, etc? Should not the nurse at the first window be trained to be more aware of cases like mine and triage usrough? I'm quite sympathetic to those in pain but cases showing classic symptoms of heart disease and strokes should be taken more seriously I believe. At the time, I actually was not afraid of dying but having a stroke, like my mom. It was not until I saw how it would be devastated my family and friends to see me gone that i wanted to speak out and just share my experience. For the sake of young moms and dads and grandmothers and grandfathers with similar symptoms like myself please make a change in the triage. All I can say is, we came in at 2-2:30... I was given blood thinners and heart monitor after 11: Regardless I am good now, Dr. XXXXXXX saved my life. DR. XXXX in XXXXXXXX operated on me. Another amazing competent doctor, I was so blessed. The TIME SPENT is not really the issue, not if you are being attended to, but when you are not, when you obviously have heart disease symptoms and concerned for clots, it is a long time to just sit and wait and not being care for. Should our conditions not be a priority? After I was admitted to the emerg ward, the nurses were very kind to me and took very good care of me. When I had to go to the restroom it was nasty. I told the nurses and they said they would write it up. I understand that at the time the emergency floor was full of patients on beds even in the hallways because of the flu outbreak. All the more to have the bathrooms scheduled to be cleaned more often in emerg. That is minor issue but an easy one to fix. While on the cardiac floor, the medical staff were amazing. The doctors, nurses and techs. All were superb. I did not want to bother but I felt it needed to be said in order for those who are in the position to make changes, will do so.

It took more than 10 hours for a dr to see him and meanwhile the nurses 'caring' for him were not in tune to the seriousness of why he was there. It was as if they saw an old man there with gas issues and it would just go away. It was in fact more serious than that! Once the doctor came, after 10 plus hours of being on a stretcher in front of the nurses desk in the hallway, actions began to take place. He was in fact having the onset of a heart attack and had a serious bowel obstruction!! From that moment on my father's health & outcome was unknown! After several tests (Cscan, MRI, ultrasounds), he was finally sent to cardiac care where the nurses and care there were exceptional. He spent 3 weeks in the hospital, underwent surgery and recovered from a bacterial infection. As his daughter, I was disheartened to witness the lack of care, respect and courtesy from one area of your hospital (emergency) to the next floor where he received the care, respect and dignity that he and others deserve. If I was not by his side throughout his entire ordeal, I have no idea what 'care' he would have received in emergency. I hope that these comments will genuinely be reviewed and additional training, support and resources will be offered to staff in the emergency department. Their lack of concern could have resulted in my father's outcome as fatal and that is not acceptable - for anyone. Even a sincere smile and a quick genuine check in asking how you are would go a long way! Human dignity is what the health profession should be all about ... should it not? I hope that my father will never need emergency care again, because the thought of that worries me. Again, hope these concerns will be reviewed, and actions can be taken to ensure quality for all!

I find it interesting that your survey is for the time period that my mother was admitted, XXXXXXXXX to the emergency room at the XXXXXXXXXXXXX site, to XXXXXXXXX when she left the Brock floor (3rd), even though she was then transferred to the 1st floor, XXXXXXXX wing of the same hospital and was not discharged until XXXXXXXX, upon my request. Do you not want the same set of questions answered as to how the ???extraordinary caring??? for ???every person??? ???every time??? for the time period XXXXXX, 5 PM to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX approximately 10:30 AM? After being transferred to the XXXXXXXX wing, after a couple of hours passed, my mother said to me ???this is where they put you to die???. Many disappointing events took place in the 89 hours my mom spent there. Not one RPN or PSW introduced themselves to us, nor did they call my mother by name. I understand how busy the staff was and is. My mother, in spite of being XX years and has all her mental capacities is slow to do things for herself in the morning. I was there to help each morning to get her ready for the day to help out the nursing staff. However, here are some of the disappointing facts about her stay at XXXXXXXX. XXXXXX, PM: PRN or PSW gave an injection into her stomach area ??? no gloves ??? no wipe ??? no explanation XXXXXX, 9 PM: My mother is blind in one eye and is diligent with her eyedrops that are given every morning (at breakfast) and at 5 PM or so (dinner time). At approximately 9 PM she rang for someone to come, waited 20 minutes only to have the PRN or PSW come to her bedside and yell at her ???you are not my only patient. I have 12 others to look after, what???s your problem? Two patients in the room witnessed this event and told me the next morning. My mother never rang again for the duration of her stay. XXXXXX: I asked for a basin to wash my mom and get her ready for the day and was given the container that sits in the toilet to measure urine. I looked at the PRN or PSW surprised and the response was ???what???s the matter? It???s clean??? XXXXXX: Physiotherapy: No time slots. However, I was told to make sure to ask for my mother???s pain medication half hour prior to physio. ???Of course???, I said, ???what time is her physio in tomorrow???? In the morning was the reply. What half hour would you like the medicine administered? Oh, at breakfast is fine. My mother never had physiotherapy before 10:30 AM for the next 3 days. XXXXXX, PM: I asked where I could put her soiled diaper (she is urine incontinent) as I couldn???t find the ???soiled waste??? container in the hallway. I was told just use the waste can in the room. There were 2 other patients plus visitors. And housekeeping came once a day and had been there already. There are other incidents that occurred, but I am sure you can appreciate my concerns by now. After one night in emergency and one night on Brock (which the emergency discharge nurse gave to my mom to be more comfortable and it was available). I wanted to know why she was being moved downstairs to XXXXXXXX and I questioned and expressed my concerns. It took the discharge nurse from the XX emergency area 20 minutes or so after my many questions and reluctance to have my mother moved to the XXXXXXXX area before it was revealed that XXXXXXXX was part, of the hospital but not part of the XXX. It was run by a private firm. The discharge nurse was kind, caring and showed me empathy but did not want to tell me the information that it was not part of the XXX. My impression of the particular floor was questionable in the cleanliness and staffing as I had been there earlier this year to visit someone. My mother resides in a retirement home and I asked for her to be discharged on the XXXXXXXXX. I spoke with the doctor for that floor, who was kind, considerate and compassionate to all my concerns. He agreed as she needed no medical care and her home agreeable to have her come back. The doctor also arranged physiotherapy to continue for 5 weeks, once a week. In a more positive atmosphere, my mother would recover faster. My goal writing this letter is NOT to name individuals or get anyone who works there into any disciplinary discussions. With the exception of a couple RPN???s and PSW???s, most staff were not friendly or kind. They gave the impression strongly and sometimes verbally that they were overworked and understaffed. I can almost agree form my observations BUT that does not give them a pass to talk sharply or be rude or take some dignity away form elderly patients. If they do not like their chosen profession, then perhaps they should be looking for another occupation that they do enjoy and can be proud of. Why is the cleanliness or lack of, acceptable? Where are the supervisors of housekeeping? Who is monitoring this floor ??? XXX or the XXXXXXXXXXXXX site administration? During the time my mother has been back at her retirement home I have come to find out that the area called XXXXXXXX is run by an outside firm. I think it is the same company that provides morning and evening care for my mother at the retirement home. If that is so what a difference in that staff. They are kind, caring and have a chat and call my mom by her name all within the allotted time or less. The XXX should be concerned of this option as XXXXXXXX is in one of their hospital sites and many people are unaware that XXXXXXXX is not part of the XXX. I understand now that it is a long term care facility. FYI: Prior to her stay in XXXX when she broken her pelvis, my mother she had broke her femur XXXXXXXXXX, then had a stroke a day or so later, transferred to XXXXXXXXXXXX for 8 weeks and had a pacemaker put in. She is XX years of age and is walking with her walker again, able to speak again, picks out her clothes for the day and applies her make up every morning. I appreciate you taking the time to read my letter of concerns. My name is XXXXXXXXXXXXX and my contact is XXXXXXXXXXXX or mobile XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXX is my mother, your patient.

Anything else (e.g. comments from relatives, other departments, general hospital feedback) is “No”.", "input": "Comment: \"I arrived at the Emergency Department with a highly swollen seroma containing a blood clot, a side effect of a double XXXX carried out in XXXXXXXX. The surgeon who carried out the XXXX (he operates out of XXXXXXXX), on seeing some photos, urged me to immediately go to an Emergency Department, as the site was very, very swollen. He said to request the site to be given an ultrasound and drained, as the swelling was starting to bruise the newly healed incisions. He also said to print out his e-mail recommendations, which included his personal phone number, saying he would be happy to speak to any doctor or surgeon who was seeing me and saying that as my surgeon, he was ordering the drainage. I was in pain when I entered the hospital, the swelling was so big I couldn't move without the stretched skin hurting. My XXXX were starting to stretch and warp as a result as well.   Although there were only four people in the Emergency Department, nurses weren't available to speak to, and the wait was very long. After being admitted, I, and the other patients, were brought into another waiting room -- I say without exaggeration that I was waiting for hours and hours to be seen by a doctor. Again, there were four patients -- the other three also expressed concern; one had arrived with a severely swollen toe that had gone purple. After the check-in, nobody checked on us, spoke to us, looked at us.   After the hours of waiting, an Emergency Department doctor looked at the seroma, told me, 'that's a seroma', assured me that 'it's a very common XXXX after a XXXX and that 'it's very easily drained.' After prodding and poking it some more (ignoring my saying that I was in pain and terrified by the swelling), he said 'I don't feel comfortable carrying out this procedure, I'll call in a surgeon, it won't be a long wait.' I was a bit frustrated -- if, in his words, seromas are common and very easily drained, why can't a practicing attending doctor in a hospital do it? But I decided I could be patient. I didn't want to be XXXX or demanding. I agreed that I would wait for a surgeon. The doctor disappeared for about a full hour -- I had no idea what was happening, if he had been distracted by someone else, if he was still getting the surgeon ... I felt very helpless and unsure.   After the hour had passed, he returned, saying, 'good news! I found a surgeon who will come to see you, it won't be long -- maybe a couple of hours.' He said this with a straight face. 'It won't be long -- maybe a couple of hours.' I have no idea what patience he expects from people. If he'd just phrased it differently, like, say, 'I did find a surgeon, it will take a while for him to see you - it could take a couple of hours, is that ok?', and checked on my pain levels, I wouldn't have been frustrated. But he acted like I had won the lottery or something. I was speechless, but I didn't want to leave without having the seroma drained. (I'm still tremendously disappointed that if a seroma is as easily drained as EVERY doctor, surgeon or otherwise, tells me it is, that this doctor felt he wasn't up to it.)   So I waited again. He wasn't lying when he said it would take a couple of hours. It took over two hours, sitting in the waiting room, nobody speaking to me, nobody checking up on me, me being in pain sitting there, until the surgeon arrived. I understand that Emergency Departments can get busy, but it wasn't busy that day. I was there. I could see that it wasn't. Close to five hours of waiting in the Emergency Department and the only people to speak to me had been the nurses checking me in and the doctor who didn't treat me and left. I felt very helpless and ignored. The surgeon arrived -- not wearing a name tag, so I don't know who it was. He didn't introduce himself. He had a brief look at the XXXXX, said 'the bruising isn't that bad' and that I should go home. He didn't 'feel draining to be necessary'. I told him the drainage had n ordered by my XXXXXXXX surgeon, I showed him the e-mail, and the phone number, begging him, BEGGING him to please just call the XXXXXXXX surgeon to speak to him about it. I asked to please just get an ultrasound, as requested by my XXXXXXXX surgeon, because the size of the seroma was worrying. He refused that, too. He said I was worrying too much and that the fluid would just get re-absorbed into my body. He told me to go home. I asked him what I should do if it doesn't get better, as over the course of a week, it had just ballooned and gotten worse and worse with no sign of stopping. He said 'if it turns yellow or looks infected, come back in, but until then, stay home, take some painkillers, and wait.' In so many words. He refused me treatment entirely.  I do find it VERY suspicious that the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX surgeon refused to treat me, a XXXXX individual, currently XXXXXX. Would he have treated a ciswoman with a XXXXXXXXXX seroma the same way? Did my XXXXX identity inform his decision to ignore my XXXXXXXX surgeon's requests, to refuse to do so much as take an ultrasound, to refuse my pleas for treatment, to ignore the fact that I was in pain? Obviously, I can't prove that. But it's certainly how it felt at the time. And XXXX individuals being denied medical treatment isn't exactly new.   This is not an XXXXX, this is simply how it felt.  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is home to surgeons, doctors, and nurses, who have helped my XXXXX and actively operated on me and have been nothing but kind to me. I'm not speaking about everyone working at the hospital. But this ONE XXXX, whose name I still don't know, because again, no name tag or introduction -- he DID make me feel like he was denying treatment based on my being a XXXX.   Leaving the Emergency Department I was in pain, felt like nobody cared what was happening to my health, felt like nobody cared that I had been in the department for six hours and not received any treatment or advice on what to do next whatsoever.   Panicked, I made an emergency appointment with my general practitioner, who was immediately alarmed by the size of the seroma, referred me to an ultrasound clinic -- the ultrasound was done the next day -- and was rushed to another surgeon's practice to begin draining immediately. I will not name names here. There's little point to it. The surgeon I'm seeing to have the seroma drained has been working on draining it for the past 8 weeks. It's a slow process, as the fluid pocket had swollen to such extremes that the first draining yielded nearly XXXX of fluid all in all, and had to be carried out over the course of two days as there was too much and too widely spread to drain in a day. As a solid comparison, the seroma contained enough fluid to fill a Coca Cola can. The chest had gone from flat to about a B-cup as part of the swelling.   And yet the surgeon who saw me at the Emergency Department said draining it wasn't necessary and to just go home.   Not just that. The seroma had formed around a blood clot and the fluid was a blackish red, had a thick viscosity in places. The surgeon who is draining it -- is still draining it, I went to see him again today for my latest appointment. He has explicitly said that there was absolutely no medical scenario in which this fluid would have been reabsorbed into the body, it would've only brought about further health complications, and that I did the right thing in going to my family doctor and him for a second opinion. He has openly told me that draining a seroma of this size was the only possible answer to the situation, and that he vehemently disagreed with the surgeon I saw at the Emergency Department. (He did say that yes, surgeons are allowed to refuse procedures, and not knowing who the surgeon in question was, he couldn't speak as to why the decision was made.)   I've now spent two months in a compression vest and getting the seroma drained ag and again -- but at least it's being done by someone who takes incredibly good care to drain it carefully and painlessly, who never refused any kind of treatment, who sees me in a timely manner, who makes follow-up appointments to see how things are progressing. He could also speak to other post-surgery effects I was experiencing and is doing so with compassion, patience, and respect. He never dismisses me nor my concerns.   I try not to think about what would've happened to my surgical site if I had listened to the surgeon at the General Hospital who told me to 'just go home and wait'. I'm glad I found proper care elsewhere. I think it's profoundly disappointing to have to hunt for it, again, even after my XXXXXXXX surgeon -- whose medical orders and opinion were completely ignored by the surgeon at the hospital -- wrote an entire e-mail specifying what he required to be done, and where to reach him immediately.  This is not my first time having a bad experience at the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Emergency Department. A while ago, I had a XXXX performed, and at some point during the healing process, the incision site started to seep blood profusely. I was in the waiting room waiting to be seen for hours -- I wasn't given dressing, I wasn't given attention, I was bleeding from a fresh surgical site and I was simply told to get some toilet paper from the washrooms and hold it against the wound while I waited. For hours. I wasn't demanding to skip to the front of the line, I was just hoping to maybe be seen by a nurse who could apply a temporary, sterile dressing so that I might avoid infection and not sit in the waiting room with toilet paper clutched to my abdomen, afraid of what might have happened.   This has been my last visit to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Emergency Department. I may in the future still be referred to surgeons in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and I will certainly still go - a lot of good surgeons I've met work there. I am not tarring them all with the same brush. The vast majority of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is incredibly competent, caring, and kind. But these two experiences, the last experience in XXXXX, at the Emergency Department, has made it very obvious to me that I will not receive respectful treatment there -- or indeed any treatment there, as was the case. Looking at online reviews of the hospital, I am not the only one with such experiences. I don't know what the issue with the Emergency Department is, but someone really needs to sort it out.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Also taking antibiotics. From Attachment - Hello: If this could help: my problems you All along the family doctor made me believe that all my problems it was me. After 32 years of taking medicine such as Nortriptyline for 25 years to treat anxiety and depression Note: this drug is meant to be used for short time use only. After having so many bad episodes went to the hospital finally on the 5th episode, one doctor convinced me to stop or else: I did not stop. I told the family doctor he said no you cannot stop. But I did stop but it was very hard on me. This drug caused me to have a prostate enlarge or issue, have a catheter for 3 months because I could not empty my bladder note: even dough I could still pee. This caused me to have heart problems again went to the hospital for this. After to have a Turp operation done that it did not go well. Still peeing frequently this drug also caused me Analgesic Rebound Syndrome: medication overuse headache Hemicrania Continua: chronic resistant headache pain always on the same side of the head. Just found out by the neurologist what my problem is after 32 years. Been taken the Micardis for high blood pressure for 17 years note at least 8 of these years together with the Nortriptyline you can imagine the pressure on the had. On XXXXXXX I went to the hospital for back pain, stomach pain & headache pain like I've been doing for so many years: note all this is caused by taking the Micardis, because the doctor doesn't know the side effects the doctor said I can see that you are suffering. I know that we are missing something hope one day you will find it and he said I will tell your family doctor to send you to a neurologist thank the lord he said all your problems are caused by the medicine that you took or taking now. Note: I did not needed to have a catheter done because I could still pee, so having this for 3 months was very trying and uncomfortable and then having the Turp operation done that it did not go well. At the hospital they should be more careful on requesting this catheter done because I could still pee: but to arrange to see a urologist to do the Turp operation note: I had this bladder issue for 10 years so I think I could of waited 3 months to do the Turp operation. Catheters should be done or in and out catheters only if you could not pee? At the hospital: when they ask are you taking any medicine for high blood pressure and you say Micardis 80 mg the computer should say, side effects are dizziness, headaches, blurred vision back pain stomach pain ringing in the (unreadable) and head, sinus, stuffy nose, sinus p cough. Each person that takes this should write all the side effects in a small card and have it on his wallet and look at it each month for reminder: because all medication it's always may? Cause so we ignore. Now I'm still in the same pain and having a hard time stopping taking the Macardis because it's become a drugged matter in my body. But I need to stop so that I can deal with the chronic persistent headache and the prostate issue: note it took 10 years to figure out that my bladder did not empty out it was always full so many ultrasounds and it showed that it was always 800 ml in the bladder I used to ask at the clinic where it was done if I had an issue because I used to tell them that the pressure was so great and hard to pee they said your family doctor will discuss. Not so he would say you can pee than you care okay the same with the urologist this too should be looked into how to deal more properly and not just guessing. At the hospital so many times are you taking any medication yes. Nortriptyline: for anxiety and depression the computer should say this drug should be for short time use only. Side effects are: nausea, vomiting loss opp. sleep problems, dry mouth rease sex drive, vision changes, little pee or no urinating. This caused all my problems. Again you should carry all this info in a card in your wallet for a reminder: everyone who takes medication should have a reminder because I know so many older people don't have a clue what they are doing all they say, my family doctor said I should keep taking I know 3 people that had car accidents and they are still taking the medication that caused the problem. Because the doctor or patient are not being reminded what the medication is causing? Note as soon as I put my glasses on to read it hurts the whole head I complained this to the family doctor on the first month of taking Nortriptyline he said go see a eye doctor so I did and he said go see your family doctor all this still happening for 32 years.

My family doctor was unable to resolve and no testing done when I saw her on the second day. I was quite concerned by 9 days, and went to the hospital. At my emergency visit the doctor had me do blood test, x-rays, and I also had to give a solid stool sample, which I was unable to do at that time. They gave me a stool kit to take home, which I was able to complete the next day and brought back to the hospital lab. Two days later the emergency doctor called to advise they had the result and I had an infection. A suitable antibiotic was prescribed and the problem was fully resolved after taking the med cct on for 1 week I saw my family doctor for a follow-up and she went over the hospital tests/reports with me. As with the emergency doctor she was also unable to give a cause and as per her initial diagnosis believed it was due to an unknown virus. She advised me on means of recovery (nutrition, probiotics, rest). There have been no flare-ups since Thank you to all the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX staff involved, for their assistance with my case I think your emergency staff is the best in the city\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Also I was not clearly explained how the equipment worked and often had no pain medication being delivered. Also some of the nursing staff were rude and ignorant. I had been told by my doctor that I needed to have a blood thinner injection so the leg circulating equipment could be removed. Within 5 minutes of the doctor leaving I asked my nurse of the day for the injection so I could begin walking around. The nurse refused and advised that I would not get the injection until 9 - 10 pm that evening as they did not give it in the morning even though the doctor said I was to get it. So I was forced to wait almost 10 hours in bed without the ability to move or get up due to the equipment.

Possible premature discharge from visiting doctor (see detailed note) 2. blood draws and tubes left in veins overnight - bruising and redness. 3. Some test results not explained (i.e. Troponin and heart issues) Overall, thank you for the care and tests leading to identification of pulmonary embolism and medical treatment of this disease. 1. Visiting doctor was almost ready to discharge me on XXXXXXXXX. My oxygen levels dipped to 86 overnight and even though levels were up to low 90s thereafter and was still on oxygen and in bed and mentioned to dr that my oxygen levels were 90+ only b/c I was on oxygen. But what would happen when I was walking and not on oxygen and asked the dr if I was going to be sent home with oxygen. The dr. verified and I stayed in Emergency until early evening and then transferred to 5th floor. After lunch my oxygen was removed and I walked to see if oxygen was stable. Once stabilized, i was discharged I feel that if I had gone home too soon I would have had bad difficulty. 2. I have small veins and it is hard to draw blood. Some people seem to be more meticulous and better to find a vein that works. The tubes were left in my veins for hours and overnight. Both arms were very bruised and red, irritated and inflamed where tubes were left overnight. Next day they had to use my back to draw blood. I have gotten a rash on my left arm where there was a large bruise from blood draw that was unproductive. I didn't sleep at all while in Emergency and did not move from an upright position in bed, thinking I couldn't turn on my left side b/c of BP monitor and blood tubes in right arm. It would have been helpful for a nurse to check in and ask if I wanted bed down for the night. It was also extremely cold. 3. I was given an explanation of essential information re\" blood clot in left leg and pulmonary embolism. I would have liked more information, but I got the essentials. I am still puzzled about the TROPONIN results and do not understand explanation on \"MyChart\" My family doctor also could not explain. I was very pleased that I did get good diagnostics and treatment. Dr. XXXX left me her card with information to call thrombosis unit if I needed to do so, and I thanked her and all members of the team for \"Saving my life\" I am deeply grateful. My comments are only to notify you of any fine tuning, Under these pandemic circumstances, I am so grateful to have received such good care. Now, when residents are performing tests, that's good - however 3 MDs and one nurse also trying to get blood (unsuccessful) all at once was just too much, I would have liked a little more explanation of what the residents were looking at (not only general explanation) while performing ultrasounds(s) of lungs? heart? calf?

Both visits were because of what turned out to be, a pulmonary embolism Both times, there were problems with the check in process. On this day when I was asked about the location of my pain, I put my hand directly below my breast to indicate the location. I did this specifically so that the location would be clear to the nurse. I discovered hours later when I finally got to see a doctor that it had been listed as abdominal pain rather than chest pain I likely would have been treated sooner had that error not been made. Them, I had to return to emergency a couple of days later. There were problems with the check in process. Somehow I had not been registered properly. After waiting 3 hrs, I went to the desk. That's when they realized I was not in the system. This happened to 3 others that were sitting near me that day. During my visit to emergency, on the day that is the subject of this survey, I was admitted to the hospital about 3 am (which was now the following day). I was in a great deal of pain and was not feeling well at all I certainly did not feel as though I should be going home. Although I suggested to the doctor that I did not feel well enough to go home, then I was released at about 10 AM. I went home but had a very difficult and painful time at home and was not able to sleep due to pain. I then started to cough up blood and returned to the hospital emergency the following day (because of blood in cough) and more tests were carried out I am talking about this because I really believe there was too much of a rush to release me from the hospital The nurse that had also been attending to me while I was in the hospital was also very concerned about the fact that I had been released as she had seen the difficulties I was having ... pain and low oxygen. The doctor that made the decision for me to be released had seen me for only about 2-3 minutes. My recovery from the pulmonary embolism since then has been slow and difficult and perhaps the decision to release me so quickly contributed to that. I hope that you take the two main points about what I have written into consideration the results of your survey. The two points being the ER admission (unreadable) as well as what I truly believe was a premature release from the hospital, or evidence by the need for me to return less than two days later.

It was obvious, even in the ambulance that this was more of a precautionary action on the part of the paramedics because there was no rush in getting me to the hospital, nor was there any rush on the part of Emergency staff, once we had arrived to attend to me. I was perfectly fine with this because by the time we arrived I knew that I wasn't going to be, nor should I be, a high priority patient. I only had a couple of issues with what happened during my time at the hospital. The first is that, when I was asked to wait in the Emergency Department waiting room I immediately noticed the large TV that regularly listed the anticipated wait times for various colour priorities, however, nobody told me if I was blue or yellow, so I had to go ask one of the admissions staff which colour I was so that I could get a sense of how long I could anticipate waiting. This brings me to my second issue. I work for one of the Emergency Services myself so I'm very well aware that as an Emergency Department the staff have no way of knowing when a patient might come in who needs immediate attention of the staff. What was somewhat dispiriting was that it was around 2200 hrs when I found out I was a yellow and the wait time was estimated to be about 3 hrs. I assumed based upon these projections that I would get out of the hospital at some point between 0100 and 0200 hours. But as the hours ticked by nothing happened. It was around 0300 hours, a full 5 hours after I first saw that the anticipated wait time was going to be around 3 hours before I was brought to a 'exam room' if you will, where I was left alone for the next 1.5 hours. I didn't get released from the hospital until just before 0500 hours and had to go to work at 0700 hours. I question the value of providing anticipated wait times to the public when the Emergency Department is unable to come remotely close to meeting those times. Everyone understands that in a hospital emergency department there may be unanticipated delays but when a 3 hour wait is nearly doubled, the TV becomes a source of resentment rather than a source of useful information. After all, everybody can accept a half-hour delay, but 3.5 hours when you've already been waiting for 3+ hours in the dead of night? Other than that the service was great.

I just wished that my doctor and the people at the hospital knew how to treat a transgender patient. I took the double dosage of spiro because my doctor suggested it. I took a suggestion from my doctor because I trusted them. Most of the symptoms: Random palpitations, Needing to pee after being in bed for 4 hrs, difficulty breathing at night, difficulty sleeping, diarrhea my left foot and fingers were tingling I think all of these incidents happened because of my double dosages. I'd needed to drink lots of water, go to the bathroom often, sometimes would have heart palpitations discovered that the reason why this has been happening was that my doctor asked me if I wanted to double my dosage of spironolactone since the month of XXXXXXXXXXXX and I agreed and I've been needing to go to the hospital because of those reasons. I'm not blaming my doctor for this because I made this decision, but I had wished that my doctor monitored me more closely. Since yesterday I asked my doctor if I could stop taking spironolactone for a week and half the dosage of spiro and she said it was a good idea.

I came into the ER nose bleeding like crazy and told the nurse I was on blood thinners. I waited an hour, then was put in another room for 2 hours, maybe even 2.5 - 3. I don't remember ever seeing a nurse, just the one who brought me to this room. I was swallowing so much blood and clots, I was getting very concerned and was told to go back to my room. Waited so long the dr. tried 3 different techniques and nothing worked. He then packed my nose and told me to come back in 24 hrs. The next day, the packing in the one nostril was saturated with so much blood. That ER dr. said, \"Oh, no, we can't take it out yet. Wait at least another 48 hours.\" OK, I'm immunosuppressed (had a liver transplant) and was worried about infection. The ER dr. would not budge. He told me not to come back & hold up dr's time that they have to deal with very sick people. OK ... I was not happy went home sleeping in a chair for now 36 hrs! I went back to ER at 9 p.m. that night and got the dr. I had at first (he is XXXX). That's all I know about him as I didn't even get an emergency report! He gave up on me, and I waited till the a.m. until this ENT dr. who \"really\" knew how to treat me. I was gone home about 3-4 hours later bleeding stopped!! Awesome dr. I would like to have the name of this ENT dr., to see him in his office. He treated me very well, understood how ill I was swallowing blood for as long as I did! He also told me, I should have \"Never, ever\" had the packing in my nostril for that long in no time he had the packing out, and I had a huge clot come out with it. I was very nervous, and he really calmed me down. I have no ER report from this evening and I'd like one along with that dr's name if possible. Drs & nurses really need to understand the complications that can occur if we don't get seen in a reasonable time frame. My name is XXXXXXXXXXXXXX Phone #: XXXXXXXXXXXX. 1. I am diabetic type 1. 2. I'm a transplant (liver) recipient. 3. I'm on Warfarin - blood thinner. If I'm bleeding threw a box of Kleenex, I think I am sick enough for an ER dr. I also have high blood pressure & other chronic illnesses. Believe me, I don't want special treatment, I just would like some common sense here ... that's all. I'm very disappointed of my care, until the last day, I couldn't wait ANY LONGER and went to the ER @ 9 p.m. - I got my dr. - an ENT specialist!!! the next a.m.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I woke up in a different place every day until I got to XXXXXXXX and got no sleep. Really unsettling they put you in the ambulance and drop you off someplace. They need to tell what they are doing. I got a letter saying I was confused. Damn right I was confused because of lack of sleep and where the hell I was taken to. This was an ugly experience in my mind. That has a lot to do with the organization the hospitals belong too. The covers you experience in the hospital. When I got home it took awhile to get sleep properly. They send in a prescription with 15 items on it. Take one twice daily. Take a quarter of one twice one 3 or 4 mm wide and 1 or 2 mm long. Hard to cut that. Have a whole bunch of pills not sure when to take them. Turns out 4 of the 15 mess with your sleep. 1. They have to be more specified when they write prescription. Hard time to figure it out. The pills you get possibly for 2 or 3 exceptions do not look the same as you got in the hospital. That is a problem could lead to all kinds of problems. I think it is important that you get a list of your prescriptions and when to take them. Once daily is not answer. Causes a lot of grief. Do not have a definitive answer on when to take them. At the heart institute some guy inform me he was going to put me on a drug that caused me to black out. One of the problems why I could not sleep my roommate would call out in the night and the nurses did not do anything.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

There were not enough questions on the survey pertaining to the doctor's care specifically. I understand they are very busy but the wait time was very long. Also there was no question about the food but it was good. There was no daily cleaning I was shocked about this during my stay. I noticed there were some areas that were not cleaned. The should maybe consider using vacuum cleaner's instead of a mop. The mop I saw in the ICU was disgusting and there was no dusting done at all during my stay. I never saw anybody clean the sink in my room. There were two of us in the room but the other person did not use the bathroom or the sink so it was only me but it should still be cleaned at least daily. One things I noticed was all the worker's were all very jovial in a good mood and uplifting. They all seemed to be in happy. They were very accommodating for the phone as I don't have a cell phone. The transition from XXXXXX and back was done very well. When I was put in the ICU, they put me in a bed used for people who are really bed ridden and it moves and it felt like I was in a raft on the ocean. I could have asked to moved to another bed but I asked if it could adjusted and they told me it could be unplugged but the air would leave the mattress. I eventually unplugged it and I ended up in a hole but I did not make a fuss about it. I had no clear follow-up either before being discharged or after leaving the hospital but I did get a phone call about a program for heart patients which I am going to participate in. They advised me I would get this call and they were so busy this could be considered my follow-up but it was sort of unclear. It was considering the gravity of my situation.

Use pagers during night to communicate with health team NOT speaker system for Codes during night!! Reinforce care ... kindness Highly suggest A 'Secret patient' be admitted to evaluate & to advise of quality of care Improve communication with family - provide greater information as it relates to anticipate rounds/expected visits with doctors Always respect family and patient ~ patient and family are highly educated & informed. Incident. Patient told to be quiet because sick people are here. Patient was insulted ~ Patient was calling out to hallway in night for assistance because call bell not working. Nurse came in and spoke to patient ~ told patient it was because she was not pressing call bell correctly. Family checked in morning ~ call bell defective - needed servicing...on cardiac floor!! Informed Floor Manager. Patient was surrounded by 3 staff - bullied at night time for wanting to call her daughter in middle of night regarding CBD oil. Made to feel stupid. Denied phone privilege.. Daughter is XX and patient retired XXX XX. No patient phone in room.2 long term admissions by ambulance (1) XXXXXXXXXXXX to XXXXXXXX ( entire time in windowless room in ER XXXXXXXX (2) XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX (1) XXXXXXXXX for blood disorder ~ no platelets - arrived XXXX by ambulance. Treated with high does of prednisone per Dr XXXXX. **While in XXXXXX ~ Security housekeeping and nursing team uncertain how to accommodate patient with CBD Oil. No one knew what to do. OT thought patient should get up to walk with walker - patient had to advocate for herself. Due to risk of fall and NO PLATELETS, patient HIGH RISK..no movement!! Patient instructed OT to consult with nursing team/Dr XXXXX. Patient is XX!! ( retired XXXX from XXX) A stranger entered patient room in XXXX at 10:30 p.m. 'looking for her'. This stranger was a staff member from retirement home who is NOT family. Alarming! Mom felt highly vulnerable - alone, asleep, no phone. Discharged via ground transfer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX returning to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. No instruction regarding side effects of high dosage of prednisone = Mania Readmitted with cardiac arrhythmia on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX to XXXX by ambulance Medication list provided to paramedics upon transfer - apparently NOT shared with pharmacy. Instead, while heart racing to 180, pharmacy technician wanted XX year old to share her medication list from memory. Family suggested she research it on computer rather than disturb a very ill patient. Patient Safety **Security issue: While in orange zone awaiting tests/room, during day time an 'impaired street person' walked easily into XXXX, walked past station, walked directly to patient...pushed thru curtains and attempted to engage with patient, Family intervened, and escorted 'street person' to hallway, stopping a staff member asking for SECURITY. Staff member in replied, I do not work here with shrug. (Standard uniform identification would be advantaegous to determine who is housekeeping, PSW, RPN, RN,) At this time, 'impaired street person' fell abruptly to ground with eyes rolling back in head. Family members screamed CODE BLUE to alert staff in XXXX or elsewhere to help. **No security came, no follow up..instead, family felt patient was highly vulnerable and accessible to 'street people' without any security present. **Communication, cascading and sharing patient information at every & all transfer points/touch points is deplorable at XXXX. XX year old was XXXX visitor for years & numerous admissions. Seemingly at no point did data entry clerk (or other) at ER note her religion or insurance information. Family questioned about incomplete patient records, and attempted to comprehend why clerks/staff not completing NECESSARY FIELDS on computer. Finance said 'it's optional' 'and an ongoing issue'. Optional??? It is apparent no leadership/clear directive to ensure consistency of records (the database), or efficient, effective communications between ALL DEPARTMENTS! This is paramount as a patient record is a living document. End result, to add to stress Family had to visit admission, finance ( numerous times in person & phone calls (inefficient use of time, resources and business tools), volunteers, as each department has limited access patient file. Clearly adds more work stress frustration for family - get the information accurately the FIRST time and cascade to all department/entities. Both admissions apparent departments work in silos. Even to the point of family being told a specialist (Dr. XXXXX) can not come onto the floor without an invitation. Well, if the patient has a blood disorder and readmitted in less than 2 week after being in his care, Specialist should be invited/consulted and see patient bedside, Inconsistent policy/procedure for CBD Oil management. Staff/Security all confused. Inconsistency of care. Rotation of staff is confusing and new staff can NOT identify decline/improvement because they do not know baselines.

Again, from emergency room assessment to care on a medical floor, the staff were amazing, helpful, attentive to my concerns, questions + worries.

These are the little things that made such a difference I feel truly blessed by their care + support XXXXXXXXXXX From Attachment - XXXXXXXXXXX This winter, I had two hospital experiences at XXXXXXXX The first admission on XXXXXX was for emergency surgery for a XXXX. My post-op recovery was on the surgical floor, first in special care unit, + then on the general surgical ward. When I was discharged, my incision was healing, but unfortunately back pain was an issue, which I assumed was related to my XXXX.

My comments reflect both my hospital stay experiences. Again, I feel blessed by the professional and excellent care I received. I believe the specifics of their care would be a meaningful reflection of all who attended me. Those nurses doctors, staff in radiology + cardiac lab, my nurses on XXXX floor, students, dietary, and all the volunteers + porters who blessed my days XXXXXXXXX To the amazing staff + students of XXXX floor I am writing to thank you for your very professional and excellent care during my recent stay in your unit (XXXXXX) Your skilled, caring hands, encouraging words, and health teaching helped me overcome the many health challenges I faced.

Also I found the night staff very loud. I was close to the nursing station and there was a lot of loud chatter and laughter even into the early morning hours. I closed the door, but was still disturbed by the noise of the 'party' going on at the nurses station. At about 1:30 hr., I asked the staff to 'keep it down' and they complied. I felt this was very unprofessional and not considerate of the patients needs for a good night's rest. I found a bug in my room and reported it (apparently it was a bedbug).  For over three hours, my roommate and I had to sit out in the hall while the room was cleaned and sanitized. Not a fun experience. Also felt the nurses were usually in a hurry, and spent as little time as possible answering any questions or requests. There never seemed to be time to actually have any dialogue with them about my condition or my concerns. An extra 30 seconds at the bedside would have been nice. While these are some of the negative aspects of my stay, I want to state that overall, it was a good experience, and a very memorable one!.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I then spent four days in the ICU and four in the \"general surgery\" ward before going home.  About a week prior to this incident I had an \"ostomy reversal\" surgery (I had an ostomy because of a perforated bowel the prior year).

I don't mind a 7 hour wait but the nurse can acknowledge the patients and see if they need anything lack of interaction made things more frustrating. You don't know how long it will be and then be brushed off by the doctor was the icing. Better communication even though you are busy can't treat them like number.

I probably got to the hospital around 4:30 in the morning and I wasn't put in a bed until 10:30 at night. Most of the time before that I was sitting in the waiting room. The diagnosis was a heart attack and I had stints put in. I don't know if it just wasn't their top concern but there was a very long waiting period in the hospital.

I felt guilty occupying a bed in the emergency for about 24 hrs relative to the circumstances of other patients at the time. However, at no time was I made to feel any less important.  In fact, care and attention exceeded any 5 Star hotel, not that I plan on a revisit anytime soon.  Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX's bedside manner was exemplary including the swift reassurance that my worst fear, of having sustained a stroke, was unfounded. She was also proactive in scheduling a surprising early MRI, a referral to an in-house audiologist for thorough tests and advice on self-practice to reduce the reoccurrence of the initial Vertigo symptoms.  Although I am still waiting for a definitive final assessment of the scans and tests, I am glad to report that I have resumed my 5 days-a-week high impact Ariba Cardio classes at the XXXXXXXXXXXXX.  In this day and age of rampant criticism of hospital services and wait times, it was evident XXXXXXXXX hospital had raised the bar of excellence. I am sure that this culture has been nurtured by your personal tireless pursuit of a dedicated patient-first philosophy at all levels.  My sincere thanks and congratulation to you on your leadership.  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  P.S.

I am absolutely sure I have paid my dues from my contribution tot his society and legacy, and I am sure as hell I would not like to see a deterioration occurring that will obliterate the gains made by previous and successful people of this province. My observation at the hospital was an eye opener and someone should say something about it before irreparable damage be done and which will cThe quality of professionally qualified staff in my opinion are second to none.

As an XXXXXXXX & a previously one engaged in England in an health environment & coupled with the fact I am quite familiar with - the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX since XXXX, I saw first hand the deterioration of infrastructure maintenance as I mentioned in my letter to XXXXXXXXXXXX - we have the expertise why not fund them and stop cutting back so we can have a system that all XXXXXXXXX can be proud of.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX. The deterioration of health facility infrastructure due to government's cutback. Respected Sir, I have been recently hospitalized at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for almost 7 days for DVT. I was at that very institution twice before in XXXX and XXXX for knee surgeries. What I have discovered between the previous and present stay was astounding. The doctors, the nurses, and the technicians are world class, hard working, very knowledgeable and very efficient, despite the resources at hand given to them by our government of XXXXXXX, and the cutbacks they face from restrictions by government. We should thank God for their ability to still perform flawlessly within their parameters. However, I could make some comparison from XXXX to XXXX in the area of facilities infrastructure which begs the question of \"Is this an XXXXXXX Canadian Hospital or a hospital in a third world country\". Enclosed I am sending you some pictures of some shocking scenes of Rm #XXX of the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. First of all it took me three days to get a room but more than thankful that I received one in the end with the covid-19 raising its ugly head again. I even suggested to the authorities that I can pay the difference from my insurance semi to private if one is available. I finally got room XXX, this room I was told was a private special room, very clean and reserved for people with severe breathing problems. The first thing that struck me after the nurses have taken the vital statistics and left was, if this is a special room for severe breathing problems, then what the others in the block will look like? First of all it looks as it is is a storage room all cluttered up with old toilet seats and a walker with only a foot of space to get to the other side of the bed, the curtains were half way hanging and if you try to close them it will all come down. For storage of personal items it was all filled with old plastic bags. The bed that you lie on the mattress was so old and the area where your bum rests there is a separation of padding material and when the head rest is raised, your bum slips down into the hole resting on the iron crossbar which got too uncomfortable for sleeping resulting with backache. The nurses were quite gracious to fill the hole with two extra folded blankets when I complained. The floor of the room and other areas like the washroom and where the doctor supposed to clean up after attending patients left much to be desired. Duct tape used to support skirt board from falling down, hole in the walls, damaged gyprock that emit dust, skirting board half removed and damage, a pale under the bath sink to collect waste water. (Enclosure of photo of proof). The bath door cannot be closed fully and when left partially open the constant stink of bathroom surrounds the room especially during the night when you go to sleep. I think after I mentioned this to a nurse after 2 days I was moved to a semi-private room #XXX with another patient who was on dialysis machine. This room was fine functions normally as a hospital room but here again no curtain in the room can func\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I have no idea why your survey offers only English and Chinese. This was truly the worst experience of my life. I went in for an unplanned emergency c-section and ended up in the ACU . During the c-section delivery there was a man pounding on my chest so hard that it felt like my ribs were about to break. I was told that it was to move my daughter and get her out. As a result I has difficulty breathing for days after due to the pain every time my ribs expanded and was placed on oxygen for most of my stay. I mentioned to the Doctor and Nurse but was told that it 'couldn't be that' and was probably as a result of a blood clot in the lungs. After tests were done it was shown that I didn't have any blood clots in the lungs or legs. Your nurses are inconsistent,some are wonderful and others should simply be fired. When I came out from the c-section I mentioned to the nurse that I didn't feel well and I was literally shivering and she ignored me. When I was then transferred to my room and my vitals were taken it turned out my blood pressure had dropped and I had a fever ,at which time the doctor (Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX) was called in. I was very upset and explained to Dr. XX that the nurse had purposely ignored my symptoms and requests to have my temperature checked. In addition she would not explain to my family what was going on. In the coming days they sent me to have my legs checked for blood clots. As I was being moved I told the nurse that I was bleeding and it did not feel like the normal bleeding that I had due to the c-section. She ignored me. When I got to the ultrasound area I told the technician that I was bleeding and literally begged him to call a nurse because I didn't feel good and he told me 'it won't be too long' .As I was being transferred back to my room I ended up fainting in the elevator, and I had a blood clot hemorrhage and again went into the Op room. When I was taken out of the ACU I was transferred to a room that had a delivery bed which was so uncomfortable I couldn't sleep My husband had to threatened to file a complaint for me to get another bed. During my recovery the Nurses and Physical therapist recommend I use a walker to get better. Then we were told (by NUMEROUS staff) that there's only 2 walkers in the ENTIRE hospital. One was already being used and the other was missing since the PREVIOUS year. SO MY FAMILY HAD TO BUY ONE. How the XXXXXXXXXXXX finds this acceptable is beyond me. I truly hope that you take these feedback seriously and try to improve your conditions at this hospital and train your staff to listen better. My only regret is that I gave XXX the benefit of the doubt because it was close to us and I did not listen to my husband when he said not to go to your hospital.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

My special thanks to the Cath Lab Department including XXXX, XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX, Dr. XXXXXXXX and all of his wonderful team attending me three times in the Cath Lab, all the nurses at Coronary Care Unit on the 4th floor including Dr. XXXXXXXXX, XXX the pharmacist, XXX, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, XXXXXXX, XXXX, XXXXXXX, ..., nurses on the 9th floor, especially XXX and XXXXXXX. However, I think there is still room for improvement: 1. The Cardiac Care Ward on the 9th floor is old and not spacious at all. Nurses have to share part of patient's room. This is very uncomfortable for both nurses and patients. I personally hardly had a good rest either day or night because it was very noisy (lots of noise from nurses talking and chatting, noise from paperwork, from toilet flushing, noise from shoving chairs, etc.). Nurses were talking and laughing loudly just like in the absence of patients. That was the only thing that bothered me the most. 2. All the nurses were so amazing, except for one lady on the 9th floor (Cardiac Care Ward) who was my nurse on the morning of my discharge (XXXXXXXXXXXXXX). She almost did not help me when I needed. For example, she asked me where my socks were. I said I did not have socks. She asked me how I could go to washroom without socks. She did not even bother to give me a pair as a nice nurse named XXX did some other night for me. She saw some garbage on the patient's mobile table, she pointed at the garbage bin and told me to go put it there. Other nurses always helped me with it because I was not supposed to move much after a PCI procedure. Then, I had to call an Uber to go home on discharge. When I told her that the Uber guy is 4 minutes away. I meant that she could start to take me down in the wheelchair. It took even more than 4 minutes to go down to the lobby. However, she showed attitude, raised her voice a little bit and said :'I DON'T HAVE FOUR MINUTES. Tell him to come and wait at the lobby. When he was already there, tell me!' Well, I could hear from inside that she had time to chat with her colleagues, but not 4 minutes for a patient. That was so sad! I don't want to be mean to her. This is in no way a personal attack, but I have to tell the truth in the hope that something should be done so patients like me could get better services. Thank you.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

XX  Drs name was/is XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  To XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Administration, Board and Patient Relations XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Ladies and Gentleman: My name is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  I was a long time resident of XXXXXXXXXX with a condo unit at XXXXXXXXXXXXX  Over the years I certainly visited XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital several times and had a fond feeling for the new addition.  However, at this, my very senior time of life, I have been so severely disappointed, of what has happened to me since XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  This situation that I found myself in, has been detrimental to my health, my pain levels having been unnecessarily challenged to the extreme for such a long period of time.  I had been in great pain since the day before, XXXXXXXXX, and I was too busy to have it looked after because of volunteer appointments and scheduling.  Before 8 am on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, I was ill and in pain, having cancelled my archives volunteering downtown and had my daughter take me to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital.  She works in the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and was able to take time off work.  We checked into Emergency Department with few people there.  Triage went quickly and my pain was severe.  The Triage nurse was astounded at my blood pressure which was close to 200/179, I had low grade fever and must have looked like a very sick person.  It got busy with people and more people being admitted.  Nurses came and asked more questions and finally a doctor came by and ordered blood samples and urine test.  All which were done, while I was in such pain as never before.  Nurses finally told me that nothing was unusual, and that the doctor had now ordered a CT scan.  I was grateful, because at this point I began to think it was some cancer or frightening condition.  I showed one and all a requisition of tests hoping that these could also be administered.  They are: (Routine Body Imaging of: Renal area, Pelvic, Transabdominal, Transvaginal) that my own Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX had prescribed a few days earlier, as a point of seeing what was ailing me at a routine appointment on XXXXXXXXXXX.  Dr. XXXXXXX also prescribed me Teva-Naproxen 500 mg.  The female doctor, XXXXXXX, who attended me at the hospital, said we will have to go through some of those tests.  Which never came to fruition.  Suddenly, because of my illness and pain, and wiht my daughter XXXXX's help I was at a CT scan area where the \"flank area\" was scanned.  I recall the word because of \"flank steak.\"  Time passed back in some inner waiting area, where it was decided that I should have morphine administered for the pain severity.  I even recall, before being numbed, that some chap beside was complaining at my getting morphine and he didn't.  After many hours, and procedures, I was told I was free to go and a Dr. XXXXXXX wrote me a prescription for Ratio-Lenoltec #3 300/15/30 mg.  No diagnosis for pain and reason for suffering.  She seemed extremely tied up this day with the various patients and their demands and was probably the only emergency department doctor there at that time.  For the next few days, I was home bound and scared and in pain.  I cancelled more appointments and obligations here at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and slept most of the time.  On XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, very early and with little sleep, I pressed the lifeline button for an ambulance because I was beyond pain and much worse.  They could not take me back to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital but instead took me to my local XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  On entrance they said my blood pressure was at 190/78 mark.  My other daughter XXXXXXXXX had come to see me and had chased another ambulance ot the hospital only to find that I was on my way in another one.  Tears for me and heartache for her.  We were quickly placed in an a where questions had to be answered, of course.  And here comes the crux of my letter.  A nice, bright eyed, young, Dr. XXXXXX came to check me over.  When she heard of my condition of sever pain, itching, burning, unable to sleep nights, her face brightened.  WITH HER GLOVED HAND, SHE TOOK HOLD OF MY SHIRT IN THE BACK AND LIFTED IT SHOWING MY DAUGHTER WHO SAT BEHIND ME THAT i HAD THE SHINGLES VIRUS.  SO SIMPLE.  IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES IN DR. XXXXXXXXXXXX'S PRESENCE, SHE HAD ME DIAGNOSED - JUST LIKE THAT!!!  My daughter XXXXXXXXX and I were both astonished.  The doctor spoke of care and conditions while medication was being administered to me.  Just the blinking relief of knowing what had ailed me for almost a week, was finally solved by a brilliant person.  A HANDS ON DOCTOR.  NO ONE, NOT ONE, PERSON AT FANCY XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX HOSPITAL LAY A FINGER ON ME IN DIAGNOSIS.  NOT ONE.  Here at XXXXXXXXX, I was prescribed as medication, a jar of compounded cream with LIDOCAINE in it for topical relief, a script of MACROBID 100 MG., an anti-viral me AURA-VALACYCLOVIR 500 MG., (Take 2 tbs, 3x daily).  With the scripts in hand we stopped at drugstores to have these filled, although the compounded medicine wasn't available until XXXXXX night XXXXXXXXX.  How does a senior administer a cream to their middle back?  I called several places such as XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX and one other but nothing came out of that.  Finally, XXX Medstaff called and said a REGISTERED NURSE WILL COME XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX TO DIAGNOSE PRESENT CONDITION AND TO HELP ME OUT.  (At home then had had to improvise with a 10\" red rubber spatula to try to find those unseen welts on my back).  A pleasant, young person came, took a look, gave me tons of information on how I could have possibly got this, took my medication information and helped me out.  This morning, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX at 8:35am, I get a call from XXXXXXXXXX by Dr. XXXX's office re visiting nurses, who stated (to my utter surprise) that they are now not able to send a person who would help administer cream for severe pain to someone's back.  I could have sworn ... In conclusion, I want your hospital admin to know, that even though my donations have been small, and my volunteering a long time ago, I liked this hospital in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX just fine and though since my ex-husbands condition and life came to a conclusion there as well, I felt as if it was \"my family's hospital.\"  But ever since an old, dusty, built-on-steep-hill XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital with it's cardiac rehab department who has helped me so much, made so much normal sense with heads on doctors and nurses I must see that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital is not for me anymore.  All glass and mirrors and smoke, but lacking in staff common sense.  It's easy to say, you can say, but examine my words for what has happened to this one person here.  I'm on road to recovery but have suffered in agony for two weeks in my XXXX year, through the non-assistance of anyone in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital.  My personal physician Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXX is a gem and I will gladly see her again.  But I'm hoping that you at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital will come to see the HANDS-ON HELP IS WHAT IS NEEDED, WITH MORE STAFF not seemingly unfeeling doctors and nurses.  This all for your information.  Sincerely, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

Came in for sever headaches, fatigue and cycling fever. Nurse in ER tried to use veins in my hand after explicitly asking not to, she failed at successfully doing it the first time, when complications occurred they went with my forearm as originally requested. EKG machine would beep randomly giving false information (ie. Said that I was not breathing when I clearly was), my first 3 nurses were exceptionally good about either stopping the machine from beeping or checking on me. However, there was a problem in communication with the last nurses I was under the care of as 1. Thought had sleep apnea because they were following what the machine said and not what previous nurses had advised (my infectious disease doctor even confirmed the machine was not in working order) and tried to talk over me when in my attempts to explain. 2. They did not check on me as regularly, so I did not get my medication in time to manage my pain, this led to my condition worsening. 3. Arrangements for me to be moved to the XXX floor at 9 AM, I was not moved until 3:30 PM. Although the care on the XXX floor was exceptionally than the last experience in the ER, better communication between my doctor and the nurses would help as my conversations with my doctor led me to believe that I was to be put on stronger medications while I was in pain. Unfortunately, I was being given the same medications I had repeated told staff I had taken prior to entering the ER. I was not until I spoke with my anesthesiologist on an operating table that I found out I was not on stronger medication. I was told I had been scheduled to have epidural blood patch and could not eat, however I did not anything to east from 6 PM, the day I informed, until 8 PM the next day waiting to hear from my anesthesiologist. While all of the details were clearly explained and addressed my concerns this were based on: 1. My anesthesiologist didn't appear to have performed and epidural blood patch. 2. The anesthesiologist was going to be on vacation after my procedure so I would have to speak with someone on call. 3. After that I would be speaking to another completely different anesthesiologist (not the on-call anesthesiologist). I am satisfied that the anesthesiologist I spoke with presented the procedure to me as optional rather than something that needed to be done, advising a more conservative medical approach. The care I received from the XXX floor nurse was exceptional my qualm was enforcement for the hospital visitation noise rules: One of the symptoms I came into the hospital with was sever headaches. During my stay I had to endure a staff member playing loud music in the halls while attending to their duties. In addition, the patient I share my room with for the last 2-3 days on my stay consistently had 4 guests speaking loud in the shared room. It would be beneficial to enforce hospital rules for others who are admitted under similar conditions.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Everyone - including the doctors saw & heard this & no one came to assist I had to drag the chair to a private sitting area as I didn't know how to unlock it or how to remove the tray. No one came to help moms neighbor told us this happened every night. They would put her in the chair & remove her to take the hall for the entire night. She was upset by this & thought it in humane when mom wasn't even causing a problem I spoke with the nurse manager after & she said it was to keep her calm & stop wondering. She gave her a sock activity to do & some colouring which she didn't do. We were asked to provide a PSW for the midnight shift. At $3500 hour for 3 weeks this would have cost $2000.00 per week I said we couldn't afford this but on nights needed we would come if called. One day I arrived to find mom in the hall at the nursing station & removed her to her bedroom to visit her. Just as I had removed her from the chair ( I had finally figured out the lock system) I was called to XXXXXXXXXX staff ad XXXX worker when I finished the conversation my mom was back in the chair & locked in at the nursing station I asked why? As I was upset. The next day I was asked to meet the nurse manager early before a visit I was told off for yelling at her staff who was on her first day of work and I had made her cry. Well I was crying every day but no one cared about that I was further told that mom was the least in need of attention of the 24 patients, some of whom were dying they had asked us to provide a night psw & we refused so they had to have her placed in the geri chair. The end result of the geri chair was a pressure sore that required a wound nurse to treat upon her discharge from hospital no one at the hospital found the sore. It was a home PSW who found it 2 Mom had behavior issues of agitation & defensive actions when approached for cleaning & diapering we frequently had to explain dementia behaviors to staff & give them attentiveness on how to approach her we brought in books, magazines, puzzles coloring and a toy pet therapy dog to calm her. Staff distributed these items to the hall (unreadable)! 3 on the day of discharge mom was dressed to go home when I arrived to get her. I was told I had to get a transfer chain myself. Meanwhile I had a torn ACL & used a walker! Luckily I had a PSW come with me so she brought mom to the lobby at XXXXXXXX exit while I drove the car from the lot onto XXXXXXX & around the hospital to get her once home, I noticed blood on her sleeve. I pulled it up & it was black & blue form her wrist to elbow the other arm was the same there were embedded finger nail cuts on her arms fresh with blood this took over a month to heal from the wound nurse treatment. Photos were taken then an agency PSW attended & discovered the pressure sore in her cockis area photos taken I reported all of this & the gera chair issue to Ms. XXXXXXXX in the complaints department the outcome of this investigation was of poor standard and I received no written documentation of the final result from Ms. XXXXXXXX. The nurse manager had in her statement with mom at home 10 days, then placed in LTC & then COVID I have not had time or energy to pursue.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Next day only in afternoon, surgery was performed. Considering it was critical surgery on his right eye, there was no clear instructions by doctors for what symptoms we should be looking for neither any immediate follow ups scheduled.. First appointment was given all the way after 3 weeks.  It was really unfortunate that there is no option for us to see the same surgeon after surgery if we have critical symptoms prior to appointment. A week after surgery, my son saw flashing in his eye and blood again. We went immediately to Emergency  and doctor at emergency was such a irresponsible that he just spent few minutes and stated I did not perform the surgery so not in a position to identify any thing. Doctor also mentioned  it is PVD due to blood and it is normal even after we did explain history of his surgery. Next day, symptoms were still persist and we kept calling our Surgeon's office for 3 days in a row and no response neither no one was picking up call.  On a 3rd day, some one picked up call and we got appointment to see the surgeon who performed the surgery and he stated his Right Eye Retina got detached again so they have to perform 2nd surgery to my son after almost 4 to 5 days of our struggle.  We could avoid this 2nd surgery at all if Emergency doctor took his job seriously and examined him in depth. Because of this, my son has to suffer whole life and pay the price of this negligence considering this is government system so no doctor is really made accountable for any careless.  It is really unfortunate that after critical surgery, patient just left on his own and surgeon don't explain thoroughly any symptoms to look for and schedule first follow up appointment all the way till 3 weeks where critical surgery like Retina detachment on XX year young boy require follow up at least within a week time. Sad part is, in between if patient sees any severe symptoms, it is near to impossible to see the same doctor even after calling 15 to 20 times in a day for 3 to 4 days in a raw. If we go to emergency , they have no idea about our history and neither they take this matter seriously until full damage has been done to patient.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Anything else (e.g. comments from relatives, other departments, general hospital feedback) is “No”.", "input": "Comment: \"I have 3 concerns about this hospital stay.  1. While my daughter and I were in the ED, the doctors involved in her care had a lengthy email debate about which department should admit her as a patient. This debate went on overnight for many hours, while I waited in the ED without an update. When the update finally came, around 4:30 am, it was that I would need to wait in the ED for an indefinite period, as the department to which my daughter had been transferred did not have any beds available. By that point, I knew we were in for a stay of at least a few days' duration, so I thought this could not possibly be true. However, no other solutions were offered, at least until I, pretty forcefully, objected - under the COVID rules at the time, I would not be permitted to leave the ED to get food, I couldn't switch with my husband, and there was nowhere for me to sleep. Folks. A patient's care plan should not involve, as your first option, an indefinite stay in a department that doesn't permit the patient's caregiver to access food or sleep. Very luckily for me, a room was found about an hour after I raised my concerns. I appreciate that there are probably all sorts of difficulties with finding a bed/nurse on short notice. However, one was found very quickly after I complained - why wasn't finding this alternative bed the first option?    2. During her stay, my daughter required IV antibiotics. She was quite active and the IV fell out or was pulled out by her many times. The IV team usually came quickly to insert a new IV. On one occasion, however, the IV team was called but was unable to come for a few hours, so a nurse from another floor was sent. This nurse poked my daughter three times unsuccessfully. We were not in any danger of missing the time to administer her dose and I was not advocating for a faster IV insertion. I have no idea why this happened and it caused my daughter unnecessary distress.   3. Initially, my daughter was to receive IV antibiotics for two weeks. The plan was to insert a picc line, send her home, and arrange for home care nursing to deliver the antibiotics via pump. The picc line was inserted, but there were no home care nurses available over the XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXX holidays to administer her medicine. The discharge planning team suggested instead that we use an alternative pump, that we could be trained to use ourselves (I think someone referred to it as a balloon at some point), but when they looked into it, they found that her dose was too small to be administered this way. Because these two options were off the table, it was decided, after a consultation with infectious disease, that she could be given an oral antibiotic instead. I said at the time that this was a smart solution, and I still believe that to be the case. However, could it not be anticipated that home care nursing would not be available over the holidays, especially during the COVID pandemic? Could the consultation with infectious disease not have taken place prior to the picc insertion, perhaps with the knowledge that home care nursing might be unavailable? Because of a blood clot formed when an earlier picc line was in place (when she was born at 25 weeks' gestation), she required enoxaparin while this second picc line was in. I understand it's difficult to anticipate the twists and turns that might arise when administering complicated medical care - but could these things truly not be anticipated? Was there no way to avoid administering a blood thinner to maintain an arguably unnecessary picc line? I do wonder.   I think it's worth noting here that, notwithstanding the above, the vast majority of my interactions with the health care providers at XXXXXXXXX have been professional and respectful, and it is obvious that these are very knowledgeable and competent people who care about my kid. I will forever be appreciative of the care she has received during this stay, as well as during previous stays (hoping to avoid future stays!). T said, nothing is perfect 100% of the time and there's usually always room to improve.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

After she was discharged from the hospital, we had to follow a strict 1 month prescription medication at home (e.g. daily dosage of aspirin), had 2 in-person follow-up appointments (ECG, EKG, Echo, blood tests), and 2 Zoom-virtual appointments with a cardiologist and rheumatologists. Before this, my daughter was very healthy and in excellent condition. Therefore, we were very scared when her health drastically declined due to Kawasaki-- it was our first time at XXXXXXXXX and we are so grateful how the doctors, and even the emergency virtual doctor have treated my daughter. They explained to us the severity of her condition, and recommended the right course of IVIG+ steroid treatment for my daughter. We are forever grateful to the doctors, the nurses, the play therapists (XXXXX, XXXXX), the rest of staff at XXXXXXXXX.

We wasted unnecessary time in the ER due to misaligned and difference of opinions  2. Clearly contradicted each other - one dr would come in and say one thing and then another dr came in and said another.  Who to listen to for discharge instructions? - it was very unclear.  Luckily our pediatrician was able to guide us with all the information given.   Pressed the button for the nurses station and expressed concern with the change of my daughters breathing pattern, no one came for 3 minutes (I timed it).  Wouldn't that be something that would be of importance?  Indeed she was extremely tachycardiac and the dr rushed in shortly after the nurse did.   Lastly, the dr gave me discharge papers, yet no one for 45 minutes!, came to disconnect the urine bag or ecg stickers from my daughter chest and bp from her leg. When finally getting the attention of the dr by leaving my head out of the room, he asked me why I was still here?  I explained no one came to help me.  He said he would send someone to come help me and within a few seconds came back and said take everything off yourself.  Left a very bad taste about XXXXXXXXX.

My less than perfect score in some areas was due to the fact that I get migraines and due to a change in medication for the ablation, I was unable to take my normal medication. I inquired of my contact at the clinic as to what prescription or non-prescription drug I could take as an alternative but never got a response. (Tylenol is useless for me.) I had a migraine for 4 solid days after the procedure that made any pain related to the surgery or monitor implant nothing. I could not get rid of the headache and I believe this could have been avoided.   My other comment is that I agreed to participate in a study which involved the implant of a LINQ heart monitor. I recently had to have it removed as it was causing me pain (movement caused it to shift, jabbing me from the inside) and inhibiting my normal day-to-day activities. I believe that given my responses to verbal questions and the Quality of Life questionnaire (i.e. that I am very physically active and a yoga instructor, among other things) that the problems with the monitor should have been predictable. However, I was only the 5th person enrolled in the study and it could have been that the researchers hadn't had enough experience yet with the monitor. I have provided my feedback directly to the people conducting the study, as I believe it is information that they need to qualify future study participants. They were very responsive to my input and helpful in arranging to have the monitor removed asap.   I have worked (professionally) with a number of hospitals, as well as being a patient at a few and, overall, I believe that XXXXXXXXX is an excellent facility and that you are making every effort to get things right.

I was in for outpatient laser prostate surgery with Dr. XXXXX.  Being XX, living on my own and having sleep apnea, Dr. XXXXX felt, since I did not have someone to drive me home or for next day follow up, safer that I stay overnight.  While the hospital/health centre is always busy surgery went well.  Dr. XXXXX was great!  After getting to my room the day nurse (about 3:30 PM) explained to me that if I experienced pain from fullness of bladder that likely there was a clot that needed clearing as it could cause bladder and kidney damage.  Service was good and surprisingly the food was much better than I would have expected.  I had some nausea after eating which the nurse administered Gravol IV.  Time to just rest and await discharge the next day.  I have to say that nurse was great.  While usually up early I was awoken by the night nurse about 5 AM.  She was teaching a student.  Very loud crashing and banging.  She was adding IV bags (wringers and saline) even though the bags were nearly full.  I thought a waste.  At 7 AM she cleared the urine bag but she also increased the saline flow rate.  Shortly after, I was in pain and discomfort, as a clot had blocked the catheter.  It took several calls to the nursing station before she arrived.  I explained what the day nurse explained about the blockage.  After several more calls she finally flushed out the clot blockage.  She wanted to send for testing??  She also told me that all Dr. XXXXX's patients stay overnight.  She hung even more bags of saline and wringers, even with full bags still there?  7:45 Dr. XXXXX came in, and he said to have the catheter taken out, and I could go home.  He was happy with the procedure and went to stop the nurse from sending the clot to the lab.  Shortly after the day nurse came on and I spoke with her about taking the catheter out so I could go home, as Dr XXXXX instructed  I think it was removed about 11 AM.  Not sure what the delay was.  It almost felt like they wanted the room to be occupied?  After catheter was removed it took some time for things to settle down and some accumulation in the bladder, enough to know that the kidneys were functioning and I could urinate on my own.  About 2 PM I was finally released and happy to go home.  So in the end, Dr XXXXX and his surgical staff great.  Day nurse great, night nurse not so good and surprisingly good food.  Surprised it took 6 hours after DR said I could leave.  For the most part a positive experience, with the exception of the night nurse, inexperience?

Simple bedside respect (I have never had a surgical procedure where the doctor has not taken a moment to introduced themselves).  2.

Many of the staff and processes were exceptional.  I am grateful that I am well and have access to excellent physicians like Dr XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX.  I was admitted to have EP study and angiogram on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  Even though the angiogram was unsuccessful (iatrogenic right iliac artery dissection occurred), he came and explained what had happened showing concern and empathy.  All that anyone could ask.  He saw me before and after the procedure.  I do understand that complications can occur.  His concern reduced my anxiety and suffering.  Several days later I had my ICD inserted by Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - he did see me briefly prior to the surgery.  The procedure was uncomfortable but bearable (could have had better pain control).  One week later I received (what I learned was a pacing shock - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) and then two additional shocks in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  I returned by ambulance to XXXXXXXXX on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX where I was told by the nurse practitioner, after she consulted with Dr XXXXXXXXXX that my ICD leads had moved and they needed to open me and replace it.  I informed the anesthetist that I was very uncomfortable during the initial surgery and asked if he could insure that I had adequate pain management.  Dr XXXXX did not see me or introduce himself at anytime during or after the surgery.  I was in pain and made it know that I was in pain and I heard someone say they were going to give me more medication which did not improve my comfort.  I could feel the suturing at the end of the removal and insertion of the leads in the RA and coronary sinus.  I was discharged at 8 pm (excellent supportive care by nurses in recovery).  We stayed in a hotel close to the hospital.  At 1 am on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I was having extreme pain especially when breathing and could not manage with extra strength Tylenol.  We returned to emergency at 5 AM.  The ER doctor said it would be a long process to determine what was wrong with me.  I just knew I was in a lot of pain.  A chest x-ray was completed at 7:40 AM and I have been told that the radiologist reported a pneumothorax at approximately 10 am.  The ER doctor came to tell us at 4 pm that I had a collapsed lung and that I might need a chest tub.  I was moved to the acute section of the ER and allowed to lie down.  Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX saw me and thank goodness for his caring attention.  He reassured me that the pain I was feeling was real and that he was going to follow me closely.  He would determine if I would need a chest tub.  I received further pain medication and was admitted at midnight after the staff took blood work to rule out potential infection (causing systolic BP to dip to 78).  I saw Dr XXXXXXX again in the morning and he again reassured me that the pneumothorax had lessened and appeared to be resolving without additional intervention.  Dr XXXXXXX arranged for me to come into see him at his office.  We returned to the heart rhythm clinic on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - repeat chest x-ray and interrogation of the ICD.  We had been through a lot and were looking for some reassurance.  We saw a nurse (XXXXXX) in the clinic.  I am sure she knows how to do the technical aspect of her job, but my husband and I were extremely disappointed in her verbal skills.

I can't say enough about how hard those girls worked, and how lovely they were to me.  So very caring and helpful despite being so, so busy.  I also had some student PSWs who assisted me with getting to the washroom etc.  They were also amazing.  Two things that did bother me about my stay: 1. There was a mix-up with bloodwork.  The blood tech took blood from my roommate instead of me - obviously didn't check her wristband or ask the patient her name.  Medication was prescribed to me based on her bloodwork - my nurses kept asking me about having rheumatoid arthritis, internal bleeding, and other things that were completely new to me, and I kept asking questions about why I was being prescribed something new based on updated bloodwork (that I didn't have done) ... I kept insisting that I hadn't had any blood drawn in two days.  It was then that they figured out what had happened and finally someone was sent in to take my blood - and carefully checked my wristband, my name, and asked me my birthdate.  Luckily, it was only potassium that I was given based on the other woman's bloodwork (and as it was my own bloodwork indicated low potassium, so it all worked out in the end). It could have had very different consequences.  2. The other thing that made me uncomfortable during my stay was having a male roommate.  My second roommate during my stay was an older gentleman.  He was not permitted to use the washroom in our room - it sounds like it was because they were taking extra precautions with me (I had the droplet precaution sign posted and everyone had to be gowned and gloved and masked to see me).  So, the man never came into my side of the room.  However, this man happened to have a colostomy bag that needed changing every hour.  My concern was that the containers that were used to empty the colostomy bag were left on the window ledge, floor, and sink area in the washroom, emptied but not cleaned (very visible remnants coated the clear containers).  The smell was terrible, and the practice was very unsanitary.  The man also had a container for urinating in on his side of the room.  I was not comfortable using the washroom with those containers lying around.  After a particularly difficult night, I was visibly upset and crying when my doctor came in the morning.  He asked if I wanted to go home - I was not ready to go home - I still couldn't walk on my own or use the washroom without being wheeled in over the toilet, but I couldn't spend another night with that situation.  I finished my recovery at home with lots of help from family, and am very grateful for the care I received.  If I had had a different roommate experience I would not have been so eager to leave.  I realize people come to the hospital with any number of medical conditions, but I would have thought that this particular issue would have been managed in a more sanitary way.  The combination of these two issues - the bloodwork mix up & the male roommate with unsanitary practices - change how I would want any future hospital stays to go.  If I ever need to stay in hospital in the future, I would pay for a private room to reduce the chances of these things happening again.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

This survey has been very helpful, however, I didn't want it to reflect my care from all the nurses as once I entered the ED, both the nurses and doctors that treated myself and my son were lovely.  I feel that reading my original email below will provide a better understanding as to why I rated certain questions so low.    Thank you for your time.  ORIGINAL EMAIL MESSAGE BELOW:    On XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, I entered your emergency room, along with my husband and our XXXXXXXX old son, for the treatment of possible dehydration due to the flu.  At this point, I had been experiencing severe flu like symptoms for 12 hours and my XXXXXXXX old had been experiencing them for 24 hours.  I was also 28 weeks, 6 days pregnant at the time.  When we entered late in the evening, the waiting room was empty.  The number on the screen was number 71.  I had grabbed number 72 from the designated area.   When we walked towards the triage desks, there were the 2 triage nurses on call that night, as well as another nurse chatting from what both my husband and I could gather was non-patient related conversation, or better known as gossip.  Neither of these 3 nurses acknowledged us and we definitely made eye contact and were close enough that they would have noticed us.    We waited for what felt like five minutes before I tried to find out why it was taking so long.  The nurse that did not seem to be working the triage desk advised both my husband and I that the triage nurse (XXXXXX) would call us when she was ready, then she leaned back into the desk behind her.  I clearly indicated that there was no one in the waiting area, and we were number 72, which is when XXXXXX told me she would call me when she was ready and then they continued their conversation.  We sat down, five seconds later XXXXXX pressed the button and called us up.  In assessing both myself and my son, XXXXXX was rude, rough with my son, showed no compassion or understanding.  When I told her I was also pregnant, there was no acknowledgment.  When XXXXXX had completed her assessment, we got up to wait for the registration desk, I apologized for getting upset and explained that I wish they had acknowledged us instead of continuing with their conversation.  XXXXXX proceeded with an apology that was both lacking the empathy and responsibility a true apology consists of and then decided to just prove her lack of care and concern by saying and I quote, 'I'm sorry you waited for five minutes'.    I think you should remind XXXXXX that not everyone is a medical professional and do not know what may or may not be a life threatening condition.  I am pretty sure five minutes would make a huge difference in many cases, which is why patients trust your triage nurses to provide proper assessment and a level of care that should be the standard within an emergency department.   I have visited your emergency room just this past year alone for a broken bone, involving my youngest, a cardiac arrest involving my mother, and breathing issues that required oxygen treatment involving my father.  Thankfully, everyone has recovered.  Also, our 3rd baby due this XXXXX will be the 3rd son we have brought into the world at XXXXXXXXX with Dr. XXXXX.  We have always been treated with respect, felt heard, were involved and engaged, felt safe and that our time was valued, which is why I felt the need to write you this message.      I think we deserve better than this type of level of care and I truly hope you discuss what is expected from these three triage nurses to prevent this from happening again.  On a positive note, everyone we dealt with in the treatment area, from the doctors to the nurse that administered my IV and removed my IV were professional, caring and just lovely.    I hope you take the time to speak to both the registration clerks that night, as well as the charge nurse on duty, which was XXXXX, to confirm  story and handle it accordingly.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

The triage nurse recognized my condition and and helped me promptly.  I was put in a wheelchair and moved to a stretcher shortly thereafter.  When moving through the emergency intake area (after leaving triage), my triage nurse was moving with purpose and showing urgency which I appreciated.  It was crowded and she was trying to find room to she could take some readings and prep me to move upstairs (I believe).  Another particularly rude nurse seemed to to trying to pick a fight/start an argument by repeatedly telling my nurse to 'slow down' and 'we don't run here' in a condescending manner.  My nurse was NOT running at all and (to her credit) did not respond to the rude person.  When we found a room where she took my vitals with the help of another nurse, and the helper asked 'What was that all about?'  My nurse shrugged it off and focused on me.  When she handed me over to the next  person who took care of me, I thanked her for her sense of urgency.  I did not get her name, but she deserves a pat on the back.  She does a difficult job already without having to deal with a bully as well.  2)  Having a heart attack is scary, and  I know every minute counts to minimize chances of more extensive permanent damage to the heart.  I did not monitor times closely as I was admitted, but it felt painfully long to go through the admission process, get upstairs in the cardiac area, and then hear that they had to page the cardiologist who was on call.  They said he would be within 20 minutes of the hospital, but it is a scary wait while pain and shakes are getting progressively worse.  I heard there were a few other heart attacks (or similar events) that evening and I am not sure whether that is typical or not.  If typical, I can't help but wonder if it makes sense to have a cardiologist in the hospital on XXXXXX afternoons?\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I was very upset by this as this was a dangerous man and I should not have been in this situation. When I went there I was healthy  the doctor came in and said the baby was fine. I was in pain and they gave me some pain medication  but I had to wait a long time. When I asked again for pain medication  as I was still in a lot of pain and it felt like the first dose helped but did last very long. They told me they would be they would give me more pain medication but if they did they would be cancelling my ultrasound. The doctor told me the baby was fine and four hours later I started miscarrying. No-one would help me or give me anything to help me clean up. They only gave my a wipe and refused to give me a diaper when I asked for it. I was crying and was in pain and the doctor told me if I was going to cry to go home and finish my miscarriage. I went home and ended up very sick due to the IV they gave me which caused me to be septic  I feel this was the reason I lost my baby and almost lost my life. When I went to the baby loss clinic  the doctor gave me a pamphlet and told me to go to the baby clinic after my miscarriage was done  a nurse told me my pain was due to cellulitis and I was septic due to the IV they had previously given me. At the hospital they wouldn't do anything and I was in a lot of pain and they did not help me. They could have given me a pick line instead of destroying all my veins. The doctor lied to me and told me my home care plan was going home and I would have an IV going home. I have a new born baby at home and they would not tell me when I could go home and the doctor told me to be a patient patient. It was very emotional for me. When they finally gave me antibiotics to fight the infection  the doctor never came to tell me and told my boyfriend in the hallway about it and never did come to tell me. The nurse that gave me the IV put it in and pulled it out twice and then she wiggled it around. She pulled the tape off of the IV and instead of putting a clean one on she put the same one back. It was very painful and then she laughed saying I made a mess as there was blood running down my arm. She was aggressive and it was very painful. This along with the laughing about it was very unprofessional and inconsiderate. This was the IV that gave me the infection. I left the hospital without any explanation of what happens next. I had a blood clot and they never told me if it was gone or not there was no follow-up. They only told me they took me off the blood thinners and did not provide me with any further explanation. I could feel the blood clot moving and they told me to follow-up but did not provide me anything to do so. I am terrified to go back to the hospital. Also when being in the hospital they left me in the dirty sheets for days. I had to kick the sheets off the bed in blood  urine and feces. I had to yell about getting my bed changed and getting cleaned up. They finally started cleaning and bringing me stuff to clean up  This was very embarrassing. When I came into the hospital they put me in a room for mental health patients. Their were cameras in there and it was very uncomfortable and I felt like I was being judged for things that happened in my past and was not being treated like a normal patient. I have changed and I don't like being judged for these things.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

I felt like I (and my mother) were in a 3rd world country care was horrible, people were nasty I'm planning on writing an editorial on this experience  From Attachment - XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  To Whom It May Concern  In XXXX of XXXX I was called to XXXXXX to see mother (XXXXXXXXXXXX) who was not feeling well.  When I arrived she was dizzy, confused and had been falling.  After a day of being with her I brought her to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX around 5 pm.  We sat in that waiting room until 10 pm before seeing a doctor.  While we waited I witnessed a woman vomiting so severely that she would pass out and then recover briefly then pass out again.  She was completely ignored by doctors and nurses walking by her.  At one point I thought she had died.  We went from room to room getting required tests.  They lost my mothers chart 3 times and had us waiting for hours in the wrong room twice.  I have never in my life seen such a horrific scene in any hospital in my life.  People were walking around holding up there I.V. bags, people were lined up in the halls some crying out in pain while young children ran around them.  My mother was admitted to the hospital at around 1 am. I left the hospital at 2 am.  She spent the night in the emergency room on a gurney.  No beds or rooms were available.  When I returned in the morning she was still in the ER and around 3 pm she was finally placed in a room with a older man with severe emotional issues.  He screamed at the top of his lungs for hours on end being ignored by staff.  Occasionally when he took off his clothes he would get there attention or when he threw his food tray on the floor.  He spent his days often strapped into his wheel chair in the hall or in front of our door.  Naturally with all his screaming going on my mother was not able to rest and we both found him frightening and distressing.  I asked repeatedly to have my mother moved and the answer was always NO.  I was asked to wear a gown and gloves.  It was not fully explained to me why, only that I could contaminate the nurses station if I didn't change it every time I went in and out of my mother's room.  I was reprimanded several times for stepping out the door looking for help for my mother.  My mother was tested for Mercer.  I was not given the results until it was forced upon me to take my mother out of the hospital  It turned out she did NOT have it.  The gentleman however that she shared the room with DID have it.  So why was this man in the halls of the hospital and why was my mother in the same room with him?  Finally someone decided it wasn't a good idea for him to be in the hall because he was highly contagious.  My mother had been sharing the same bathroom with this man for over 2 weeks.  She may have gotten it from him which could have contributed to her illness, but I was never informed even when she was tested a second time.  I was then instructed by the flow nurse that my mother was not eligible to stay in the hospital until we were able to find her a suitable nursing home.  The flow nurse on the weekend had assured me she would be able to stay.  I was told she would be put on top of the list, due to her current health issues (and at the age of XX) which included congestive heart failure, dementia and the list goes on and on.  I filled out multiple home placement formes and had no idea how I was going to be able to take care of her.  NO ONE cared.  I have been an XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX citizen for XX years and I live in XXXXXXXXXXXXX.  My mother was not able to immigrate to the XX as we had hoped.  For many years we tried.  She spent 6 mos. in the XX and 6 in XXXXXX.  Unfortuntely my bother died 3 years ago, with whom she was forced to live alone in a senior housing apartment. I was informed by the Flow nurse that my mother was my responsibility and that she would need to return to her apartment.  Wh was not completely out of the question as she lived there alone.  I was not comfortable in her present state for her to be on her own.  I was offered NO help as far as finding her a place to live.  I could not legally bring her to XXXXXXX, and I could not legally stay in XXXXXX.  I was told to hire a private nurse at a cost of approximately $800.00 per week.  An impossible amount for myself or my mother to afford.  I explained this to the flow nurse over and over but got nowhere.  I was often brought to tears with the hopelessness I felt, and the lack of caring or understanding of my situation from her.  I was finally forced to find a private assisted living facility in XXXXXXX.  I picked my mother u from the hospital and took her to this facility as I had absolutely NO CHOICE.  My mother was sill in a very weak state and in hind site should have stayed in the hospital.  They made it very clear she needed to leave.  Unfortunately this chain of events lead to my mothers death.  I have to say I'm horrified at the care she received in the hospital.  If I hadn't been in her room every day she probably would have died sooner.  3 to 4 nurses at at time would often help my mothers room mate, and barely make eye contact with us in hopes we would not ask for help.  I was treated with hostility, and felt hatred from some of the staff.  Someone decided it was time for my mother to see a priest.  He was there when I arrive and of course I immediately thought my mother was dying.  Neither my mother or myself had requested a priest.  I hope this letter helps someone else.  I hope that no one has to go though what we went though at XXXXXXXXX Hospital.  I hope the powers that be take this letter seriously and look into an extremely flawed hospital.  THis hospital has serious dangerous workings.  The staff are overworked and the care is horrific.  I wish I could have brought my mother back to XXXXXXX with me.  I may not have lost her.

While I answered the survey to the best of my ability, I did want to offer some other feedback.  I only visited the Emergency Room at the hospital since the Walk in Clinic near my home closed at 8PM.  I was 99.9% certain that all I needed was an antibiotic in lieu of an infection that I developed and did not want to go through the night without meds in an attempt to catch the infection early and prevent it from worsening. Turns out I was correct.  Truth be told, I feel the issue with the Emergency Room at the hospital is ...... too many people coming in without life threatening issues.  A BIG # of visits could totally be avoided if there were 24 hour walk in clinic or urgent care clinics or fracture clinics.  Heart attacks, strokes, kidney stones, severe unexplainable pain, injury that has led to possible internal bleeding, fevers that exceed 41 degrees, babies and infants with issues, etc., these are a handful of examples of medical issues that I feel requires hospital emergency care/visits.  The bulk of the patients I saw in the emergency ward on the evening I attended - kids having respiratory issues due to colds and flu like symptoms (a visit to their family dr. or walk in clinic would have probably been as effective as I am sure they ended up leaving with a prescription for a puffer or antibiotic, others looked like they had cold and flu like symptoms, etc.  To make a long story short, I thought the staff were doing the best they could considering the volume of people that were there.  It really felt like a walk-in clinic at the emergency ward more than anything else on that evening.  In any event, that is my 2 cents.  I am not a dr. or medical professional by any extent so clearly I can't speak for why the other patients were there that evening but I hate going to hospitals, dr.'s etc. with the fear of catching something air born.  I go for an infection and leave with a phenomena.  ONLY GO TO THE EMERGENCY WARD IF IT IS AN EMERGENCY.  I don't know how to get that message out as it only takes one instance where that one person who should have gone to emergency does not and something bad happens.  In any event, thank you for the care and the option to get medical treatment after hours.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

I went back and waited 3 hours to be admitted then no one was on duty to do the test they wanted to perform.

The Pharmacist gave me a list of medications that were hard to not only see but also understand. I suggest larger print and clear explanations of the meds along with what they are for and their side effects as it is done by Heart and Stroke in their Living Well With Heart Disease manual. The Physical Exit Experience was diametrically opposite in its quality to the Entry Experience. The former was impersonal and uncaring. A volunteer should be called in to take or escort the patient to the exit of the building and stay with them until their transportation arrives. Being told that you can now leave in the room and having to navigate my wheel chair through a clutter of chairs, beds and tables just doesn't cut it.

While in ICU I my recovery could have been better served by having at least one member of my family allowed in to help me understand where I was I thought I had been stolen and was being kept captive in some blob somewhere and had my family been there it would have been a different thing so they think they dealt with a violent disturbed person when in fact I was scared for my life when in fact had my husband been allowed in I would have been settled in a few hours rather than days so that policy of not letting family members into ICU is ridiculous and I suffered for it. The second thing is the care on the regular unit on the cardiac unit was lacking they I felt disrespected in many ways and they had no they certainly don't nurse the way they used to there's very little compassion so of all the nurses on the regular floor I had one that was terrific and the rest were it was actually painful to be around them because they were so disrespectful. Other than that I had no real issues with the hospital the care in the ICU unit the nurses were fabulous the care on the regular cardiac ward completely different. And the bed I was sleeping in was broken so I've had heart surgery and I'm trying to get the bed in position to sleep properly and the bed is broken but anyway. I do want it very much noted that family should be allowed in to be with patients after any kind of surgery  regardless of what the reason is but if you're in ICU you should be allowed to have a family member in. And covid is no excuse because everyone is gowned and using wipes constantly so that's no excuse. Anyway it was very traumatic and this isn't my first time I've had heart surgery before so I knew what to expect and I had no reservations about going forward and I had some complications with the surgery and as a result I had a hard time coming out of the anesthetic and that's when someone should have been allowed to be with me 24 hours a day so had they done that I would have recovered much quicker because when I realized I hadn't been stolen I came around much quicker.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I was left with the impression that the tech was just being lazy, or wanted more time for herself by dispatching me more quickly than waiting for the 5 BP cycle to complete. In my moist recent experience with people who should be following a procedure or rules, it is best if those procedures and rules are posted in full view for patients to examine.

That being said, I don't think I have ever made a formal complaint in my life. It's not in my nature. I don't think I've even sent food back before - but! Ask me about the first doctor who treated me two days prior who also works in your ER. Ask me about Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX the condescending, abusive, condescending, chauvinistic pig that has got to be the most incompetent, rude, lazy, apathetic waste of a paycheque on the planet - and if you ask the right way, you'll get the same feedback from your own doctors, admin staff, custodians and volunteers that have had the misfortune of interacting with Dr. XXXXXXX. I wouldn't let Dr. XXXXXXX embalm a dead raccoon at a funeral home let alone treat a living breathing human in an ER. If I were HR I would fire or transfer Dr. XXXXXXX as soon as possible and divvy his final paycheque between Dr. XXXXXX and Dr. XXX for their damage control efforts that postponed the inevitable lawsuit you guys are facing keeping that man on staff. I'm hoping that's enough to satisfy the need to address his incompetence, but if patient care is not actually a real high priority - I'm sure money is! Fun fact: I actually turned down a CT scan after Dr. XXXXXXX's initial: unnecessary blood tests, ECG, Echo, X-RAY despite facing going home untreated with serious symptoms (I actually got to do X-Ray twice on that visit because he didn't rule out pregnancy first (which was literally the first concern I brought up with him) - so that was a fun extra 2 hours. Oh! And my ECG was done in the middle of the hallway with my nipples hanging out so, that was new and exciting to be made an exhibitionist for the first time since giving birth to my son in front of a gallery of med students.) After ordering all those tests and going home, I was still blacking out on the floor, dizzy, nauseous and having chest pain but was so upset by Dr. XXXXXXX's abusive, apathetic demeanor that I refused to seek care until my family forcibly brought me after calling XXXXXXXX ER in advance to confirm Dr. XXXXXXX was off. Dr. XXXXXX then had to reorder the same (but also less) tests to come up with the most accurate diagnosis. Lastly, and for the record this emergency transpired during a week where our family doctor's office was unavailable for telephone and in - person appointments. And a lot of this happened over a weekend period. I did continue to follow up with my family doctor's office regarding the visit and have alternatives to ER treatment when medical problems or symptoms arise. I've only ever had nice things to say about XXXXXXXX emerge and the staff in all your departments really but one man from one visit bullied and re traumatized me to the point I just left and had to be forced to return. I have begun recommending to friends and family they just go straight to a morgue and skip the wait.

I told her I could not lift myself up. I asked her how I was supposed to do this with the 'sternal precautions' and she said she didn't know what I was talking about and got very angry with me. I asked to see a doctor in charge and they told me one was not available. I went into afib and a resident came in and injected me with something and didn't tell me what was happening. After I complained to the 'charge' nurse I was treated even worse. I heard the nurses talking about me and ridiculing me. It was an horrific experience. After that, most of the nursing care was excellent. I did not like that I was never given the opportunity to shower or even a wash cloth or towel and soap. In pre-op I was not given a robe to wear during the ECG. I get the cost cutting but that seems pretty extreme.

On 2 occasions patient requested IV magnesium to lower heart rate - first doctor had never heard of it being used for that purpose. Second doctor cardiologist explained that patient would have to have a blood test first to determine magnesium levels. Unfortunately that is not the best way to determine magnesium levels. Magnesium has always worked for this patient!!! Heart rate stabilized when antibiotic started working. Out-dated nutritional advice given. We could go on and on and on about lack of knowledge. Paramedics stayed with patients they had delivered to ER. They stayed for hours and hours and chatted non-stop. Many of these patients were drug addicts - I was feeding them from the food I had brought in for my husband - there was no food in ER!!! These people were starving and ravenous. XXXXXXXXXX's used to be a member of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Unfortunately not any more. Patient in question had pneumonia and had been walking around with it for at least a year and a half. It started from his CPAP - mold inside which could not be seen. Class action suit in the works. Off CPAP for at least 16 months. Patient developed sinusitis and patient's wife withdrew the CPAP. Would like to discuss in person the multitude of life-threatening medical errors patient has been subjected to at XXXXXXXXXX's. Patient's wife was afraid to leave patient on his own in ER. She also caught some sort of virus involving her eyes - curiously enough another woman who had also been at ER caught the same virus - check the ventilation system.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I have a paralyzed diaphragm and had surgery to correct a deviated septum. I use a bi-pap machine to support my ability to breathe at night. Subsequent to surgery my face was so swollen that I could not use my face-mask. I informed the surgeon of this. He called a respirologist tech to administer some tests. I informed her that my breathing difficulties occurred when I lied flat on my back and offered the medical reports to support this. She refused to look at the reports. Further, she administered an oximeter to my finger when I was in an upright position and not when I lied flat to obtain a true value of the seriousness of my inability to breathe once released from the hospital. She had an agenda to ensure that the tests would reveal that supports were not needed on my release. Further, I had general anesthesia during surgery. At the conclusion of the surgery my breathing tube was taken out in a manner that it injured my uvula. To make matters worse a bacterial infection developed concurrently at the uvula site. No one from the hospital ever checked this orifice before my release. The following day, I had to rush to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with a possible DVT. Blood tests supported that clotting had occurred. I was given an injection in my stomach to help clear any dangerous clotting. The doctor in emergency also prescribed Nystatin to help clear the fast developing infection. I had to attend the next day for an ultra-sound. I have severe arthritic hands. I live alone. I had to go to my family doctor to have her order a nurse at XXX to attend to my aftercare.

From 14:30 to 22:00 everything went normal however my wife was quite tired due to the late start. Around 24:00 doctor came and mentioned that a vacuum can be used since the baby is not coming out. Until around 4-5am we have waited. Then the Doctor came and started the vacuum delivery operation. Before beginning, we were told that the head is quite down so a vacuum would help baby to come out in 2 minutes. After several trials I saw my wife suffering and doctor saying baby is not coming out 'may be the head is big'. Therefore we ended up with a C-Section. After the C-section doctor mentioned that the cord was tangled around the baby and that is the reason why baby was not coming out. I believe an ultrasound check would have helped to identify the cord problem. Moreover, we were not given an option to choose between C section or vacuum. Vacuum delivery or pushing further were the only options provided to us until they realize that the baby is not coming out. We would choose C-Section if we were given the option or told that vacuum delivery may not work. Considering that our baby is a IVF pregnancy we really found the delivery as an unprofessional and like a trial error operation. Next day of the delivery doctor was around but did not even bother to come/talk or ask how my wife is doing. Thanks God that my wife and baby are both healthy now.

And what about CTs and X-rays ordered by my respirologist? Again, am I supposed to be evaluating my experience when undergoing those procedures in Imaging? As a long-standing patient of XXXXXXXXXX's along with my entire family. OBJECT TO HAVING TO REGISTER AT THE AMBULATORY CLINIC ON THE MAIN FLOOR WHEN I HAVE A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT WITH MY RESPIROLOGIST. The only phone number I have been given, or can find (and believe me, I've tried), is for the registration desk. I have no way to contact my respirologist's office if I have a question or experience side effects of my medication; these are not things that the person on the other end of the phone, who schedules appointments, can deal with!\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

THere was poor communication to us, we were told multiple times doctor would assess us 'soon.' Despite informing nurse wish to not receive antibiotics for GBs+ until after membranes ruptured, she encouraged Mom that doctor was coming soon and would want to rupture membranes (not wish of Mom) and therefore encouraged to start antibiotics right away. Therefore 3 unneeded doses of antibiotics doses were received before waters were eventually broken at 9 am. Nurses placed 2 IVs in wrist. Despite being told they were painful, nurses reluctant to replace them. Pain in iv sites lasted weeks after birth. Since opted for private room, we stayed in delivery room for rest of our stay. This was far from nurses and we didn't see a nurse from initial shift change until 2 am when we had to call the nurse to receive a bassinet. Also, the room was not cleaned after the delivery. The placenta was left in a bag at the door. The garbage smelled of blood and my mother had to empty the garbages and linens. I passed a very large blood clot on the day after delivery. We had to ask the nurse to assess my vitals initially and after several hours. They were reluctant saying that the policy for routine vitals wasn't due yet, despite a large amount of blood passing and us being concerned. A large amount of education was presented in a rush right before discharge, this was overwhelming. During the rest of our stay after baby came , we rarely saw a nurse. This could have been spread out during stay to allow time to process and ask questions.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

I was afraid to lock the door of my apartment as not to obstruct EMS. I had a follow appointment with an older doctor at the end of my pneumonia experience weeks later. He sent me to a technician to take a breathing test. The young woman kept forcing me to breath hard into her lab gear. I kept failing. She was relentless and I continued until I fell on the floor and nearly passed out. She forced me to get a pass. Is that really a pass or the signs of a person that may need further care? I quit smoking and I am certain I have COPD but it is self diagnosed because nobody during that experience really gave a shit. I know for a fact pneumonia can be a killer so to play it down seems wacko to me. I am limited in cardiovascular activities and I can not keep up to my mates when cycling.

They got him back into his bed and hooked back up to monitors and he was in cardiac arrhythmia, and then he lost his rhythm, and then he died. Not to suggest that he may have lived, but certainly having professionals around that are sympathetic and aware that extreme restlessness, urge to use the washroom, and dizziness are all signs of cardiac arrhythmia/pre arrest symptoms.

I was directed to sit waiting area A (if I recall correctly) for a triage nurse. One other patient was being served at the triage desk, the other desks were empty. 3 staff members were present at the triage desk. The patient moved on, and I expected to be called. The staff chatted, played what appeared to be games on their phone and played music. I sat there ignored for about 10-15 minutes, there were no other patients waiting. One staff member finally looked at me across the room and asked if i was waiting to be seen!? They called me the desk I described the same symptoms. They were surprised called the person in the booth on the phone and yelled at them as they did not follow protocols. They finally turned their attention to me and commented on how unwell I looked, pale and tired! I was, to say the least, starting to feel very anxious as I was feeling very unwell. They took my information and had difficulty entering my phone number which I had to repeat numerous times. The rest of the visit and care was fine. The doctors and nurses were kind, professional and reassuring. As I was presumed COVID, I greatly appreciated the distancing and safety measures, staff disinfected the chairs in the waiting area 3 times over the course of my 7-8 hours as I waited for tests and results. I was eventually placed in an isolation room for the rest of my stay. The following morning I was seen by 2 other doctors and prescribed blood thinners. I was told I would have a follow up appointment within 3 months at the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and that they would call me. I never heard from the clinic so after about 4 weeks I called them, they had no record of my visit and could not find my details using the phone numbers I provided (Home and cell), yet the ER doctor called my home # a few days after my visit with test results. I found this to be very disconcerting, that they did not have the right number (even after I repeated numerous times when I arrived at the ER), and that I had to advocate for myself for follow up care. I have additional concerns with respect to that, but that is not related to my ER visit, apart from the telephone number issue.

They called people into a curtain area. There was a case where some were just given medicine and others were in pain. I always assumed that triage would funnel into appropriate areas. Those getting medicine should go to one area and ones in pain should go to other areas. Wasted time and wasted energy. I think things can be streamlined better and made more efficient so you don't run into people waiting so long. They knew I had prostate surgery the week before and with all the tests I had nothing was done to look for a blood clot. I never had any test for a blood clot. They ended up finding the blood clot the next morning from a doctor who said maybe we should be looking for a blood clot. This was 24 hours later. I don't understand why if it's common to have a blood clot after surgery they aren't testing for that first.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Anything else (e.g. comments from relatives, other departments, general hospital feedback) is “No”.", "input": "Comment: \"Background: On XXXXXX I had an ischemic stroke. My motor skills were affected, my perception was altered so I could not hold a fork, close a zipper or walk without falling. I soon learned in the ambulance, my ability to speak was gone - only gibberish came out of my mouth - I could not speak a coherent sentence or identify graphic pictures or printed words that were flashed in my face by the team of stroke doctors. Thanks to the swift intervention by a phenomenal team of dedicated stroke specialists and the unbelievable care I received at XXXXXXXXXXXX, there were no motor or cognitive deficits, my speech came back within a few hours and now I am home, shell shocked but so grateful to be alive and intact. I have only praise and gratitude for everyone connected with XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The care I received was exceptional. What follows are some of the things that I experienced as a patient during my stay and when I went home that could do with some improvement. Emergency Room and Hospital Care: The stroke team of doctors addressed me in a normal tone of voice in the emergency room. The young female nurses however raised their voices to an uncomfortably loud level, speaking at me rather than to me as I lay on the gurney. I am XX but it should not be assumed the elderly are deaf or incapable of understanding unless voices are twice normal level. Being nearly shouted at with questions is alarming. This is not a complaint, just something that could be made better because overall my care in the emergency room was exceptional. MRI: By the time I had my MRI on XXXXXX, I had been 18 hours without food or water. Being wheeled through long corridors, over bumps, in and out of elevators to reach the MRI room took some time and the experience of looking up at the moving ceiling on an empty stomach and being generally very stressed after the stroke, resulted in nausea and vertigo. The attendants who wheeled me around that day were engaged ina very loud personal conversation with each other and laughing, behaving as if they were transporting a sack of potatoes. It would be better if the attendants who push patients on gurneys through the hospital recognize there is a person in discomfort on the gurney and provide a quiet respectful ride. This situation happened only once - most attendants were very careful. The Discharge: When I was discharged from XXXXXXXXXXXX I was given a 242 page binder containing information with hundreds of web sites with more information. This is information overload that I found overwhelming to deal with when I got home. The sheer quantity of material and much of what I was reading was frightening and not conducive to recovery in the days following a stroke. I realize patients are diverse in terms of health education. I do appreciate the informative contents of the binder but I would really have preferred to have a doctor or nurse talk to me before I left the hospital explaining what I might expect from my body as I recovered. As I am learning, the stroke recovery trajectory is not linear with each day better than the last but more a case of one step forward, two steps back. A resident did speak to me before I was discharged but was vague with respect to my questions about the recovery process and what I might experience. It is now 6 weeks later and I still don't know why I am having the symptoms I am dealing with and whether they are related to my stroke or, being weaned abruptly from a beta blocker after 16 years, or the result of my body adjusting to a new medication - 80mg of Lipitor, or a new cardiac problem. Question 38 on the Questionnaire: Question 38 on the questionnaire asks whether I had enough information about what to do if I was worried about my condition after I left the hospital. My answer was \"not at all\". This has been a problem for me. I have seen my doctor who glanced at the discharge summary but gave me little information or reassurance about my symptoms. The disrge binder listed the name and contact information of each member of the XXXXXXXXXXXX stroke team but I was not able to reach them, only their voicemail. The Clinical Nurse Specialist however was accessible and she did provide help on the phone. Patient needs to know whom to contact after discharge: In my opinion it is very important that a patient knows whom to contact if a situation arises after discharge. Who is in charge? The stroke team doctors left the decision of whether to resume taking the beta-blocker to my family doctor who said little to me about the matter. In the weeks after my stroke, a clear understanding of whom to contact about my symptoms would have been appreciated. As it was I connected mostly with voicemails and unfortunately left to fend for myself. Stroke Survivor Liaison Group: In addition to having a clear idea of what to expect during recovery and whom to contact once discharged, a stroke survivor liaison might also have been effective in calming my anxieties after being discharged. The contact provided in my binder (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) has yet to return my call after 3 messages. There are breast cancer survivor support groups. A stroke survivors support group should be beneficial. I have watched the online videos provided by links are in the binder, but human support would be infinitely better. A Final Word: I do not want to give the impression that my experience at XXXXXXXXXXXXX was anything less than stellar. I could write pages about the positive experiences I had as a patient. The nurses were absolutely amazing, courteous, patient and receptive to patient needs. However one experience in particular stands out in my memory and I would like to share it with you: When I was told I would have an MRI, I made it clear I could not consent because of my extreme claustrophobia. I was told I could be sedated for the procedure. When I arrived in the MRI anteroom I told the technician I could not do an MRI. He asked if I had received sedation. I said no. Next, like a magician he produced a pair of long polyurethane earplugs for me, which I installed still complaining I would not do the MRI. Next he approached me with a warm towel which I speculated might be dipped in chloroform to keep me quiet but he laid it over my eyes and I was quickly subdued. Then he told me headphones were being placed over my ears and a hockey helmet over that. He explained exactly what would happen and I asked if there was a panic button and could stop if I were overwhelmed. He said yes. So as I approached the MRI scanner, I could see nothing and hear little. I got through it without any anxiety because I had no sense of being entombed, as I would have without the towel over my eyes. I found the sounds interesting and the computer generated voice announcing the length of each scan to be reassuring as it is similar to the voice that announces the next station on the TTC. The MRI technician is to be highly commended. His technique for calming patients like me is perfect. Flawless. Wonderful hospital. With sincere thanks, XXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

The nurses in CICU were also excellent the first few days.  The overnight nurse on XXXXXXXXX morning after midnight, was a problem.  I woke at 3:30 am and had to use the washroom and have drink of water.  It was extremely dry in CICU.  I couldn't find the buzzer and was told not to get out of bed.  I thought someone would come in to check on me.  No one did.  Finally at 5:30 am, I called the CICU phone line to ask someone to come in.  The nurse sat at a desk outside of my room.  She looked in the room, I waved at her, and she sat down.  She looked at me again and I motioned for her to come in.  She sat down again and finally came in 15 minutes later at 5:45 am.  Her first words to me were DO NOT CALL.  The blood pressure monitor had stopped working through the night.  I thought someone would check when my blood pressure measured 0, but no one came until 5:45 am.   The other very concerning thing happened in Emergency.  Someone, a man, came in to my room in Emerg and asked me if anything happened and I stopped breathing what did I want done.  I told him the only thing I didn't want done was to put on life support.  He repeated to me, 'so, everything, but that'.  A while afterward, I went into cardiac arrest.  I was revived with CPR and a defibrillator.  Afterward, the doctor told my daughter they didn't know I didn't want to be revived, so they went ahead and did.  I remember our conversation, and never said that! There was also another very rude nurse in CICU on XXXXXXX afternoon.  She would tell me to sit up and then raise her voice to say, Don't get up!  My veins are difficult to find, and she asked me in a very condescending voice, 'What's wrong with your veins anyhow?'   Please know that the emergency room nurse, XXXXXXX and the resident cardiologist were wonderful.  I'm very grateful to them.  If the 2 nurses in CICU had been the same as the rest I would have given 10 for everything.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

Communication was good, the team professional and competent.  A problem arose after an angiogram the day before when I wasn't permitted to rise to urinate.  There was a fear the incision (in my groin) might bleed.  The nurse had instructions to keep me flat on my back, but I felt I was going into urinary retention (I have BPH and had previous episodes of retention) and tried to explain I needed to pee.  She was insistent and I wanted to co-operate and probably wasn't assertive enough.  When I was allowed to rise I was in retention.  What followed was 10 efforts to catheterize me through my enlarged prostate - three nurse tried and then the nurse practitioner.  Again, I probably should have been more assertive.  When all were unsuccessful the urology resident was called and was successful.  This experience was intensely painful - bleeding, bladder spasm, distension.  Since leaving the hospital I have had several trial voids with negative results and more trouble with re-catherization and controlling my bleeding, including a two day hospital stay.  My urologist performed a cystoscopy and found evidence of scar tissue that may be complicating a problem that we had earlier been successful treating with medication.  I will require TURP surgery.  Unfortunately, I have been prescribed a anti platelet drug following my surgery at St. Mike's (brain aneurysm) and so the surgery cannot be performed until I can go off the medication.  I am currently living with an indwelling catheter.  My quality of life has been severely affected.  While I appreciate catherization is usually a fairly uncomplicated procedure and that medicine is not a precise science, I think it would be useful to develop a post-surgical protocol that takes pre-existing conditions into consideration more fully.  Things would likely have gone better if I had been allowed to pee, and if the urology resident had been called after two or three rather than ten unsuccessful attempts at catherization.  I am usually a reasonably assertive person and have been puzzled by my own behaviour that day.  I assume it must be related to the feelings of vulnerability and dependence induced by being in a position where you are basically trusting other people with your life.  I offer these comments not in a spirit of bitterness but with the intention of helping the hospital avoid similar misadventures.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

But I had to go to the bathroom and I had to put back the cables for the heart monitoring device, she explained me from far how to replug it myself. I wish I didn't have to do this myself. Also, one nurse was talking from the door, asking me personal questions that anyone could hear in the corridor.

They came in to examine her at 2 am and turn on all the lights. She was sleeping so soundly and they say Oh it's time to do vitals. They were suggesting medication to me that i didn't really think I needed. I think they were interns by the way they were dressed. They were suggesting really strong narcotics that I don't really need. Why would i take that if I'm fine with lighter pain pill?. My nurse suggested they put me on blood thinners because i was in bed all day. I said I don't think that's a good idea and i'll just get up and walk more which I did. My daughters and husband took me and we just walked. My surgeon was unbelievable. I had no worries and felt fully confident in him.

Anything else (e.g. comments from relatives, other departments, general hospital feedback) is “No”.", "input": "Comment: \"I was admitted for a scheduled hip replacement.  My experiences in the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, Pre-op clinic, and on the day of surgery (until I was transferred to the ward from recovery room - XXXX) were all very positive.  I was impressed with everyone along the way.    Unfortunately, I found the quality of care to be significantly inferior once I was admitted after the surgery.  I stayed only one night, and it was a terrible experience.  None of the nurses introduced themselves.  My primary concern was that my pain was not controlled from about 5pm postop until the next morning.  When I realized that I was experiencing pain when the local was wearing off, I let the RN know.  She offered me plain Tylenol.  I indicated that I was experiencing quite a bit of pain already.  She responded by telling me that I could have oral hydromorphone, but since it was ordered 'prn' I would have to make sure I asked for it.  She gave me a dose, and it took about 1 hour to have any impact, and the effect was lasted just a short time (30-60 minutes).  Feeling that the pain was coming back, I asked the new nurse for another dose.  I was told that I could not have anything as it was too soon.  I suffered for the duration and requested a dose when I was allowed.  The next dose did nothing to alleviate my pain which was much worse since it had now been uncontrolled for a longer period of time.  Again, I asked for something to control my pain and was told it was too soon.  Eventually, I asked the RN to contact the doctor because I was in so much pain.  I believe she did, however, I was only given the option of the same dose of hydromorphone (oral) or to switch to Percocet.  I have a pharmacy background, so it did not make sense to me to switch to a less potent narcotic, when I was on the hydromorphone.  I asked the RN if it would not make more sense to stay on the drug I had already started and perhaps increase the dose, etc.  I was told that was not an option.  The RN also shared with me that the doctor would not come and assess my pain.  I asked what the doctor's name was - I was not given a name, but told that it was 'Ortho on call'.  At this point, I chose to stay with the hydromorphone.  I suffered in pain and crying until almost the morning when the pain seemed to be more controlled.  In the morning, the resident consulted the pain service.  I learned in speaking to the MD that they are available 24 hours on call, and that there were many more options that could have been tried - decrease interval, give an injection, etc.  I don't understand why I was allowed to suffer and the pain service was never called.    Another concern I encountered during my admission was what seemed like a disconnect between the pre-op clinic and what I was actually ordered in hospital.  I provided a full medication history in the pre-op clinic, including providing the name and contact for my pharmacy where my prescriptions were dispensed.  When I was admitted, my regular medications were not ordered.  One medication was zopiclone 10 mg.  Instead, I was given melatonin for sleep.  I explained to the RN that I normally took a high dose of zopiclone (and had been on this for about 7 years) so the melatonin (which I also take) would not work alone.  Eventually she came back with 3.75-7.5 mg.  Again, I indicated that this was not my dose and would not work.  Eventually, I got my 10 mg of zopiclone at 2am.  The other medication that was not ordered was Cipralex 20 mg, which I take at bedtime.  When I let the nurse know that I thought I thought I should get that, her response was that it was not ordered by the doctor, and perhaps there was a reason that they did not want me to have it.  I said that I would be ok if that was the case, but thought that I would have been told in advance if a medication was being held.  She then suggested to me that if I had brought my own medications to hospital that I could take my own supply.  This obviously was an unacceptable comment - eer the drug is ordered or it is not.  People should not be encouraged to take their own medications in hospital if they are not prescribed.  All of this could have been avoided if the medication history provided in the pre-admission clinic had been consulted.   Any questions could have been resolved ahead of my surgery.  In the morning, a new nurse was on shift who delivered me my medications unlabelled in a medication cup and said 'here are your morning medications'.  I asked him to tell me what they all were, which he did.  I was unsettled to find out that I was receiving my first dose of Xarelto, an anticoagulant, without any explanation at all.  I would not even have known that I had it, except that I asked.    The last thing that I was concerned about during my stay was the number of documentation errors I encountered.  Besides the issues with my prescriptions as outlined above, I noticed some additional documentation errors.  1) The patient summary indicated that I received a consult for physio and to book appointment.  I was told in hospital that I did not need physio. 2) Melatonin on summary was written as QAM - this is a medication for sleep and is given in the evening. 3) The discharge summary indicated that my pain was controlled on oral narcotics with help of pain service.  There was no mentioned of the fact that the oral pain regimen was not effective at all in controlling my pain on the first night post-op.  4) The operative note indicated that I had surgery on my left hip.  Elsewhere in the report, it spoke about my right hip.  I will bring this to the attention of my surgeon at my next visit.  Understanding that errors do happen on occasion, my primary concern was the number of documentation errors that occurred during a one-night hospital admission for one patient.    Although I have raised these concerns, it is done in the spirit of continuous quality improvement and patient safety.  I hope that by taking the time to bring these concerns forward that the care will be better for future patients.  In particular, I would hope that the team's attention to post op pain control would be improved.  I realize that with the heightened focus on opioids that efforts are being taken to limit any overprescribing that might occur.  That being said, it is still important to address patients' pain requirements in the post op setting.  Again, the care I received along the rest of the care continuum has been wonderful at XXXXXXXXXX.  In addition, I have had family members receive excellent care.  So, I am not concluding from my one night in hospital, that what I experienced is the norm.  I know XXXXXXXXXX is a good hospital.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

My experience in Emergency was absolutely substandard. I went to Emergency mid afternoon on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with sudden severe upper mid abdominal and back pain. I expressed that I did not ever have this before and thought it was a gallbladder attack of a bowel obstruction. I had a colonoscopy 2 days prior. I waited in the waiting room for a very long time in excruciating pain. I finally was put in a room and waited for hours. I do not have the records, so time specifics are not available. I eventually was seen by the Dr. He did a quick ultra sound, said it wasn't Gallbladder. He said I needed a CT scan and it would be a while. He gave me hydro-morphine, I believe. The pain continued, My blood pressure was elevated, He finally came back much later and said the CT would probably be 2 more hours. I can go home and if it continues come back in the morning. I returned the next morning at about 7:30am, sat in the waiting room for hours, taken to a back room for an ECG and then in the waiting room again. I tried to explain that I had a problem and I was sure it was a bowel obstruction. Nobody listened. I was put in a room eventually and waited and waited,. The pain was excruciating, I was vomiting bile, my BP was 234/?. Finally in the afternoon I had the CT scan. I did have a few Xrays but I cant remember the sequence. I was seen by the surgical team ...Resident. Dr XXXXXXXX. She put in an NG tube which immediately helped the pain. It was at that time things moved and I was admitted. She was exceptional. Dr XXXXXXXX did my surgery 3 days later. He was excellent as well. I might add that I was a nurse years ago and worked in Emergency. I co-founded and owned a XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX called XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. I sold it recently. I have an insight into the medical field and I know the pros and cons. But, my experience was a shock to me. During those 2 days in Emergency...XXXXXXX and XXX, I had 2 friends with me. One was a nurse and the other was a Dr (Specialist). I introduced them as my friends, (but they all knew that they were a Doctor and nurse). but said they were not here to criticize or interfere which they didn't. i would like you to look at the 2 day Emergency records. I was so sick. I am a healthy person even though I did have cancer. I am fine and I told the Triage nurse, I didn't want my age or past health issue to interfere with my care. I have always had the utmost respect for XXXXXXXXXXXX. I live in XXXXX area of XXXXXXX and deliberately went to XXXXXXXX instead of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX which is close by. I thought that I would get better care. When I think back as to what could have happened with all the delays. ....I shudder. Fortunately it didn't. In summary, my hospital stay once admitted was good. Dr XXXXXX and Dr XXXXXXXX were exceptional. You may want to check with them as to the type of person I am. I am writing this so you are aware. There is a definite issue with the Triage procedures. The more obvious and serious conditions should be seen first. I am very disappointed with my Emergency treatment. It wasn't right. I hope this information is of help.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

We pressed the button and requested someone to show us how to properly breastfeed our baby, the call was answered and we were told a nurse will be sent to us, but no one showed up. We were forced in a way to feed our baby formula, because we had no clue of how breastfeeding works, in the meantime the baby has to pass three glucose tests in a row to get all of us discharged. The nurse generously offered one bottle of formula after another. My baby passed the first two glucose tests, and failed the third one. And we had to go through three other tests two hours apart from each other all over again. Unfortunately this happened twice.

THere was poor communication to us, we were told multiple times doctor would assess us 'soon.'  Despite informing nurse wish to not receive antibiotics for GBs+ until after membranes ruptured, she encouraged Mom that doctor was coming soon and would want to rupture membranes (not wish of Mom) and therefore encouraged to start antibiotics right away. Therefore 3 unneeded doses of antibiotics doses were received before waters were eventually broken at 9 am.  Nurses placed 2 IVs in wrist. Despite being  told they were painful,  nurses reluctant to replace them. Pain in iv sites lasted weeks after birth.  Since opted for private room, we stayed in delivery room for rest of our stay. This was far from nurses and we didn't see a nurse from initial shift change until 2 am when we had to call the nurse to receive a bassinet.  Also, the room was not cleaned after the delivery.  The placenta was left in a bag at the door. The garbage smelled of blood and my mother had to empty the garbages and linens.  I passed a very large blood clot on the day after delivery. We had to ask the nurse to assess my vitals initially and after several hours. They were reluctant saying that the policy for routine vitals wasn't due yet, despite a large amount of blood passing and us being concerned.  A large amount of education was presented in a rush right before discharge, this was overwhelming.  During the rest of our stay after baby came , we rarely saw a nurse.

This was not addressed at all & no one seemed concerned.  When asked I was advised it could be treated as a follow up.  No info was given to me regarding follow up to this despite me calling the surgeons assistant 3 times leaving a message regarding my question of where am I to follow up regarding the aneurysm.  I had not secured a GP at this time as my family GP had just retired.  I finally have one now and she is asking the same thing.  In short, I felt tossed out to fend for myself.

This sort of negligence says quite a lot about how a health care provider treats their patients. XXXXXXXXXXBecause of the unsatisfactory results by ER my family doctor had to take urgent tests and follow-up frequently two of my diagnosed medical conditions cause high heart rates/BP which I am in touch with my physician. I'm expected to have (2) surgery next year urgently my sinus infection is chronic * I came to the emergency advised by my physician, urgent care nurse, resident doctor and ENT specialist after seeing worsening/serious symptoms Now I am hesitant to come to the ER based on two unsatisfactory visits and because I might be sent home with no solution again. From attachment - Addendum to my remarks in hospital survey remarks In continuation of my earlier dated XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The CT revealed that my sinuses were completely blocked due to the delayed diagnosis (which could have been earlier when I first visited the emergency department at XXXXXXXXXXXX on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Due to the unsatisfactory response from the E.R. at my first visit, my family physician had to send multiple requests to the ENT specialist on urgent basis as my sinus condition was worsening. The ENT specialist diagnosed this as a 'chronic rhinoantritis with polyps' which can only be solved through Endoscopic sinus surgery and Septoplasty that will take place next year (XXXX). Over the course of these three months my symptoms worsened ... I am experiencing aggravating chest pain, severe headaches, dizziness and fainting spells. I went to the emergency as advised by my ENT specialist, family physician and urgent care nurse on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. It is to note, that nurses at the E.R. always seem to think that the patient walked to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX department on foot, this concept is ridiculous and incorrect. At home, I was using a walker as I could not walk well because of these health issues. My father drove me to the XXXXXXXXXXXXX, and fetched a wheelchair for me. I spent approximately 10 hours in the hospital and once all the tests were completed, the E.R. physician concluded that my condition is probably a result of 'stress or 'psychological' condition as all tests were clear. I asked whether this was related to medications or not and the E.R. physician said 'Perhaps. Your family physician can address that. We can't help you here.' This remark was bizarre. I was then sent home. Please note that despite my inability to walk, I was forced to walk out of the E.R. department foot ... in order to go to my father's car. I expected the same symptoms of chest pain the same night. After reviewing everything with my family physician in person the following day, it was revealed that I had an abnormally high blood pressure which was also noted by the E.R. physician during my first visit but not action was upon it. My family physician was very upset on knowing that the hospital staff failed to provide the basic and fundamental relief for my serve headaches and dizziness, and also brushed aside high blood pressure for being a normal symptom as the patient was 'sick' is an unacceptable logic. Through detailed investigation, the ENT specialist noted that one of my medications was known to cause high blood pressure. He was astonished as to why this was not immediately addressed by the emergency department. Untreated high blood pressure can be life threading. On XXXXXXXXXXXXX, my family physician immediately advised me to go the emergency department at XXXXXXXXXXX due to an abnormally elevated heart rate upon standing, walking and during other activities (e.g. eating, sitting, showing, lying down etc.) with chest pain and episodes of fainting. This time to prevent from being sent back home without proper testing and diagnosis, my family physician sent a fax to the E.R. department explaining the situation. However, this experience was even more disappointing. Once again, my father drove me to the E.R and my father brought a wheelchair from inside ER and escorted me to inside. One of the nurses asked the other (Indian) nurse to est me to the stretcher due to my condition. However, (Indian) nurse's attitude was disgusting! She refused to help me by stating 'you walked to the E.R. on foot, you dressed yourself before coming here so you don't need any help getting up from the wheelchair and walking to the stretcher.' I promptly clarified that I DID NOT WALK TO THE E.R and my mother at home helped me get dressed. However, she instantly ignored my explanation. Her attitude demands for urgent counseling or training because her attitude towards incoming patients was totally unappreciative. It is worth to note that as a patient whose heart rate escalated significantly upon standing and walking, I was told to go to the bathroom myself ... upon returning to the room and reconnecting my self to the computer system, the alarm went on signaling a high heart rate. However, no one came to check upon my condition. Furthermore, the staff (registration department, nurse and E.R physician) at the E.R. failed to read the urgent fax message sent by my family physician. They said 'faxes are common and reading it them would not be useful' despite explaining the situation. The resident physician suggested that they complete different heart tests (as the ECG was normal) which could reveal the cause of the elevated heart rate and corresponding symptoms. However, an hour later the supervising physician said no tests were necessary as she 'thinks' I repeat she 'thinks' this is the resultant cause of having a low thyroid.' She referred me to an Endocrinology Clinic as she 'believed' my family physician was not following up on my blood tests which was incorrect. Furthermore, she said the blood tests for determining whether or not my thyroid was low would take 'four hours' and said I should go home. Upon asking for clarifications as to 1) Why this is related to having an elevated heart rate and chest pain and 2) Why she is advising against taking other heart tests as the resident physician advise, she stated that it was her 'great belief' that is was the low thyroid which does not require heart tests. The symptoms of chest paint and elevated heart rate are psychological due to stress. I should ignore such symptoms and take of my BPM monitoring watch. Before discharging me, she said that 'if she was wrong about the low thyroid, my family physician can take heart related tests.' I question the purpose of having an emergency department when patients are told to follow up with their physicians without proper testing. Unfortuntely, I was not able to speak to my family physician before leaving the hospital; however, I followed upon the issue promptly once I arrived at home. He said that he was already reviewed the blood tests from today and that my thyroid and in perfect condition. Again, he was astonished at how the staff failed to read his faxed letter, the way the staff had treated me, failed to take proper tests and provided incorrect advice telling me to ignore such symptoms which (God forbid) could be dangerous. This situation shows clear negligence towards the patient, lack of care and attention (especially to a young adult), unprofessionalism, biases attitude towards a young adult, narrow mindset and malpractice. Under medical law this hospital falls below the standard of care expected of a hospital. God forbid, if something unfortunate happens to me, your hospital could face serious charges as I would allow my parents to sue this hospital. Once again because of these incompetent physicians at the E.R., my family physician has to run around trying to urgently (despite a lengthy wait time) arrange tests and get an urgent appointment for me to see a cardiologist. In our homes or at public places we are sending appreciation, salutes and respects to front-line workers but inside the hospital we see their different attitudes. Why? I understand that we're in a middle of a pandemic and hospitals are overflowing with COVID-19 patients, but this does not e\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

The ultrasound was from 4 days prior and was not in unbearable pain at the point this was done, and lastly, an MRI of the spine which was not even the area I was admitted to emergency for. - In tears and frustrated I advised him I still could not walk and he was sending me home - He then decided to do an examination of my leg area - In the wait for this, I contacted my family dr. and advised that I was going to be discharged with pain killers - She quickly, advised my oncologist XXXXXXXXXX had emailed her when I saw her on the previous XXXXXX, she advised that if the spinal MRI was inconclusive, to do a hip/pelvic CT instead - She forwarded me the email and I showed the nurse and advised the dr. - He examined me quickly, made a comment my oncologist never responded to him, and reluctantly (thank God) ordered the hip/pelvic CT at approximately 5 PM on XXXXXXXX - His shift then ended and Dr. XXXX took over - By 8/8:30 PM Dr. XXXX came bak with the CT results and she advised there was inflammation all over left night indicative of an infection and wanted to admit me right away and start IV antibiotics - Finally, I was getting the treatment I needed - The night shifters then started their shift and the original traige nurse came over and apologized that I was still not helped and that I would be helped this evening - I was admitted right away and spent the next night in the Emergency Department with a very compassionate and lovely set of nurses, and on IV antibiotics (Vancomycin) XXXXX (I believe was one of the nurses' names) was extremely kind and tried to help me be as comfortable as possible. All of the nurses were outstanding and it was a pleasure to be in their care. They were very attentive and tried to help me as much as possible to be comfortable. I then was admitted to my oncologist's floor the next night and spent the next 27 days at XXXXXXXX's on the oncology floor. 28 days in total. I understand people come into emergency with all types of ailments and some are not emergencies I was an exception. I do not ever go to emergency I also was in the gym a week prior doing cardio and all of my daily activities in my regular healthy and active lifestyle. Trying to discharge me with such a serious issue at hand as it ended up being active multiple myeloma or Osteomyelitis. To dismiss someone with pain meds, in the absence of any real thorough investigation, also adds to another very dangerous societal problem of addiction to pain medications. HEre I was coming inf or help with what ended up being a very serious issue, and the dr. was trying to prescribe meds and get me to leave. I had asked for a change to an MRI and because of policies, the area needed could not be added due to a variety of reasons. My MRI was 20 minutes late and was less than 30 minutes long. In addition, because of the delay in ordering a CT that was very much needed, this extended my emergency stay from the usual 5-6 hours to 26 hours. When I wa finally admitted as an inpatient, the proper MRI was then ordered, then several days later and done twice due to issue. This added several unnecessary days/costs to my stay and also took up a bed that someone may have needed earlier. Although a very rough start, overall, my 28 stay was a positive one. The staff was second to none on the oncology floor and were avocation for me whenever possible. I ahd constant communication with Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX who was excellent to deal with and although had challenges with delays out of her control, still did an excellent joith my care. The XXXXXXXXXXX's nurses and staff were amazing as well. Thank goodness the nurses in both areas and other dr's were able to assist me and offer excellent care for the duration of my stay.

Hopefully, this letter can be used as a teaching tool and help to offer better patient centered care to clients from the moment they stop in the door. Sincerely, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXThe triage nurse (not sure other name) was absolutely outstanding as a nurse/human being She had a pony tail and worked XXXXXXXXX as triage nurse at 10:30 PM XXXXX (I think is her name) was also an outstanding nurse They were both extremely compassionate as well as XXXXXX (I believe) My visit was 28 hours - because first dr was excellent/but shift was ending 2nd dr Dr. XXXXXX, refused to do a pelvic/hip CT or MRI He ran no tests/no bloodwork, instead looked at an ultrasound from 4 days prior, an x-ray that previous dr ordered taht didn't show anything and reviewed a spinal MRI ordered a month prior by my oncologist, that was not for the area I cam ein to emergency for because he refused to do test/bloodwork, this delayed my stay in emergency by another day From Attachment - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX To whom it may concern, I want to the emergency department at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX on XXXXXXXXXXX. Here is a synopsis of what transpired. Medical history: XXXXXXXXX diagnosed with smoldering Multiple Myeloma. Patient of Dr. XXXXXXXXXX (oncologist XXXXXXXXX) since XXXXXXXXXX. Cancer stable, history of infections. (MRSA, Pneumonia, Strep throat, etc.) - Suffered with excruciating leg/hip pain that extended down left leg and in groin area around XXXXXXXXXXXXXX - Saw family dr. on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for this and could not lift leg and severally reduced range of motion as well - Dr. thought I ahd a hip fracture and immediately emailed Dr. XXXXX to advise and to advise to add both hip/thigh to MRI that was previously ordered for XXXXXXXXXXXXX - Prescribed Naproxen 500 mg to manage the pain and make it to the MRI - Pain got progressively worse over the next few days and Naproxen offered no relief - When I could not bear it any longer, I went to emergency and decided would go to emergency department first, deal with my pain issue and then go do the scheduled MRI at 4 AM and head home - Arrived at Emergency at approximately 10:30 PM on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - Severe hip/thigh pain in left side resulting in inability to walk and lift left leg, and severe pain upon touch - Previously complained about hip pain to oncologist, so MRI booked previously for spine was at 4 AM XXXXXXXX - Wheelchair offered and used I was first met by an absolutely amazing triage nurse (brown hair in a pony tail) She assisted me almost immediately and tried to help as she could see the pain I was in and considered my underlying diagnosis. - Female emergency doctor assisted - She tried to have my spinal MRI changed to include my hip and pelvic bone - Was advised this could not be done - Xray done instead to rule out of hip fracture, which it did - Xray focused primarily on an enchondroma further down on my femur bone below my pain - The dr. then advised her shift was finished at 3 AM and the next dr. would follow up with me and possibly order a pelvic/hip MRI if need be - She also advised, I had to be an outpatient do do my MRI so they discharged me at approximately 3:30 AM and readmitted me after the test was done at about 5:30 AM - Dr. XXXXXX took over - I spent most of the time in an emergency rom waiting - At approximately 10:30 AM I met Dr. XXXXXX - He did not examine me or my leg, I explained verbally the issue - He came in briefly and advised was waiting on the MRI results - I advised aI ha an ultrasound earlier that week - He requested a copy of those results from my family dr, which was inconclusive - He then looked over the x-ray also inconclusive - He also reviewed the MRI which was for an area different than I came into emergency for - Finally, at around 4 PM, XXXXXXXXXXXX, he came back to speak with me and said he would discharge me with pain meds and to follow up with my family dr. and my oncologist - He then proceeded to talk to a nurse to have me discharged with pain meds - The nurse came over and I explained I could not walk and what do I do - The nurse tried to explain that I could some*6\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

They would go out for a smoke  and the hospital let them in and out. With COVID happening  I think it's irresponsible. Once you leave  you are not in care anymore. I don't care how long you're there for. Usually the nighttime issues involved those people. Because  they were making noise  the nurses were busy dealing with patient's because bells were going on . I didn't have a cardiac issue  but they didn't have room for me  so they put me on that floor. My issue is that nurses should not be responsible for those people. And the policies in the hospital should be - I'm sorry  but if you leave  then you're out of our care  because you're jeopardizing the health of other patients. I was very happy with the doctors and nurses  I thought one nurse in particular went beyond the call of duty. My breakfast was so bad  the next day she bought porridge from Tim Horton's and brought it in for me. She wasn't a nurse  she was a secretary. She went beyond the call of duty.

EMT (Ambulance) team arrived and were very professional. Pain started to subside within 30 mins (from pain level of 9 to about a 6) while they were at my place, but then as they helped move me to the gurney to transport me to XXXX, the pain returned to a level 9 again and that continued upon arrival in Emerg and while I was waiting for triage. Pain started to subside again to about a 6, and then it got better. The emergency physician's diagnosis was 'biliary colic' and provided a brief written explanation on a prescription paper with his signature, with the instruction to follow up with my family doctor, to secure a surgical consult ASAP. I met with my family doctor. He logged in and pulled down my blood results from SM's and, it was his opinion, this was not biliary colic. The results were inclusive to diagnose it as that. He was more aligned to heart related, and has now ordered a heart stress echo ('stress test'). My only concern is why the disconnect in diagnosis between the emergency physician and my family doctor.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Left messages, no call back!  At least Dr. XXXXXX kept in touch periodically with us!  If I depended on the nurses etc I would have had cardiac arrest!  What kind of nurses, nurses assistants or PSWs do you employ??  My dad has onset dementia and his mother tongue isn't English, although he does speak English.

No paperwork upon discharge or instructions!  He came out in worse shape than upon being admitted!  Imagine that!  Should be reversed, one comes out of the hospital feeling better not worse!  Just depressing to think about his stay at XXXXXXXXXXXX!  The ward he stayed in is so outdated/old fashioned it's mind boggling!  Disheartening!  Poor patients!

Unfortunately, each time the medical staff shifts changed, I had to convince a new group of politely disbelieving professionals that I did indeed have this condition, and that I was not suffering from anxiety or any other more common explanation for my symptoms. As a result, although I was specifically requesting only two things: normal IV saline (a recommended treatment for my condition) and advice as to whether I could increase my cardiac medications, my symptoms got significantly worse. I was told I could not drink anything (for at least 9 hours; I was refused IV saline for an extended time, even though that was the treatment I was receiving at home when the ambulance was called; and I was obliged to skip several doses of my cardiac medications because no one would prescribe them until I was fully evaluated. Later, out of curiosity, I looked at my records online; the notes from some of the emergency room physicians contained some inaccurate information which may have exacerbated the situation. If this is the experience of an articulate XXXXXXX lawyer in her mid 40's who arrives with a specific (if very rare) diagnosis, I shudder to think what happens to anyone who is not equally fortunate in terms of resources or ability to articulate their medical history.

I was seen by an emerg doctor, who ordered blood taken, and an ultrasound.  She also rudely said that I shouldn't have bothered coming to emerg, despite my family doctor sending me there because of worry of blood clot.  She laughed and said I should have just gone to an ultrasound appointment at an independent clinic that I had booked for much later in the day.  She made me feel awful for having come to the hospital, despite the fact that I was really scared at this point that I had a blood clot.  I waited a long time once I was there, before I was able to get an ultrasound of the lump, and then was just sort of left in the ultrasound waiting room, told to wait for a porter to take me back to the doctor who sent me for the ultrasound.  I waited over 30 mins in the waiting room, and when I spoke to the man at the desk I was rudely told to just wait and that it could be a long time before anyone came to get me.  Once I finally did get back to the doctor in emerg, she said nothing was wrong, the ultrasound showed that the lump wasn't a blood clot and I should go home.  I asked what it was then, she said she didn't know and I should just got home.  I insisted I wasn't comfortable having a big lump on my arm without explanation, and she just said there was nothing she could do and I should go home.

Anything else (e.g. comments from relatives, other departments, general hospital feedback) is “No”.", "input": "Comment: \"I've included a letter as there isn't enough room here for me to explain what a horrible stay I had.  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  Dr. XXXXXXXXXX CEO, I was admitted to XXXXXXXXXX by ambulance from XXXXXXXXXX on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX suffering from bleeding on the brain from a possible aneurysm.  For the most part the nurses were wonderful while I was in the ICU, except for the male nurse that I had.  He practically ignored me all night.  He just pushed meds and was more interested in another patient.  I found the nurse's station very loud, almost like a party atmosphere which was surprising when a patient that suffers from the condition that I was brought in for should be in a dark and quiet room, which I wasn't.  I needed a towel over my eyes as I was so photosensitive.  I was released from hospital 4 days later after being told I was going to remain in ICU for 10 days to be monitored.  Not much more was done for me.  I was released without pain management plan.  I begged for the medicine I needed to do me until I got home as my benefits card was at home.  I stayed in a hotel close to the hospital with my sisters in case we needed to go back.  10 hours later I was readmitted due to a severe headache and feeling unwell.  I was put on the neuro floor.  Here I found most of the nurses were really great, with the exception of a few.  They helped me manage my pain.  On my last day I requested a glass of water 5 times from my nurse and still did not get any.  Why is there no access to a water cooler for patients or a fridge for juice?  The worse things that I found on this floor was the excessive noise at the nurse's station, and the lack of control over patient visitors.  I changed rooms three times, not of my choice, and I found that nothing was done to control the noise, length of time stayed, encroachment onto other patient's room side.  When I complained about the noise the nurse shrugged her shoulders and gave me ear plugs.  Where are the rights of patients who are forced to share a room with others?  8 AM to 10 AM and beyond, is insane because there is no consideration of others when visitors arrive.  People are in the hospital to get well and rest and we can't do that when visitors are inconsiderate.  Nurses should be allowed to caution and ask these people to leave if they are loud.  In one room I was afraid for my safety because this man who was a patient in the same room of mine kept looking through the curtain at me and kept coming around to my side to go to the washroom which was on the other side of the room.  The only times I slept during my stay was when I was medicated with pain meds and gravol.  No doctor really explained what was happening to me.  If it wasn't for my sister who is a doctor in XXX who explained things to me would I know what was going on.  By the way, she was not treated well by doctors or nurses when she requested politely the information, very unprofessional as far as I am concerned.  I was released from the hospital on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX without the medicine I needed to prevent brain spasms or stroke.  Nor did the hospital ensure that I had access to this medicine in XXXXXX.  When I got home, my pharmacy had to order it and being a family day that XXXXXX, it would not be delivered until XXXXXXX resulting in my being without this medicine, which I took 2 every 4 hours, for two and a half days.  This medication was for a 21 day period.  I still needed enough for another week.  After calling multiple pharmacies, reaching as far as XXXXXXX with absolutely no luck, my sister who is a doctor called from XXX and got the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX pharmacy to give me enough of this drug to do until my prescription arrived.  She is the reason I got the medicine needed, not my doctor in XXXXXXXXXX.  That is so wrong!!!.  At no time was I given a clear understanding of my condition and care instructions when I came home.  All in all I would not want to come back to this hospital again.  I was released without bg able to lie completely supine, without medications, without pain management.  I wasn't allowed to even put my socks on.  When we called XXXXXXXXXX to get a request for XXXX, we were denied by the nurse, saying I wasn't a candidate because I was \"mobile\".  yes, I could walk, but could not bend down by even a slight increment as it increased skull pressure.  I needed the help and was ignored.  We ended up having to pay for services out of pocket to assist with simple dressings and showers.  XXXXXXXXX.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

The employees did not accept me.  They wanted me to leave.  The social workers refused to contact the CCAC or another agency for me to get help (Physiotherapist, residence, pay ambulance, rehabilitation, walker, wheelchair, etc.).  They wanted me to go to the shelter.  XXXXXXXX and the ex-roommate live and ransack my apartment.  They took my proprieties (Money, food, phone, internet, bed, washroom tools, etc.).  Beside that most employees are not qualified by examples the nurses don't see my veins to get the blood.  They try many times in vain until they call their colleagues to help them but vainly also.  I had infection on my arm when they tried to get the blood 11 times and more.  I prefer to go to the clinics/labs like XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  One or two nurses only work well ... And I was surprise that the hospital consider glucose level of 20 is good!  They forced me to take 5 units of insulin (Humalog).  I showed the doctor the glucose table I receive from my endocrinologist.  The doctor took a copy of the table includes the date, the time, the glucose, the dose, the food, the glucose after 2h and the graphics.  Sometimes the food was only liquid and no enough.  The IV fluid increased the pipi.  I was wearing the pampers all the times.  The pharmacists cancelled the IV fluid.  The hospital gave me Anusol for occasional constipation.  I had diarrhea for more than 1 month.  The ambulance forget my eyeglasses at home.  I have cataracts.  XXXXXXXX brought my eyeglass at D4 to a Chinese nurse.  They never find it until now.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.  SUBJECT:  My experiences Survey, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Question #47)  Dear Sir,  I received your questionnaire and I filled it out.  I am writing you this page to complete answers more particularly the question #47.  Before beginning, let me tell you that I am constantly sick.  I have Epilepsy, Diabetes II, Blood Clot, chronic back and urology pains, eyes and feet sickness, etc.  My worst illness is from frequent falling down.  I am taking more than 20 different medications.  The side effects of the illness and the medications are very important for examples seizures, dizziness, checking, all the body pain, walking problems, etc.  Besides that I have mental problems because of family and professional problems e.g. emotional disorder, angry, anxious, short lost memory, etc.  I have all the above illness because of discrimination, intimidation, jealousy, police violence, etc.  In addition, there is an opposition between my doctors.  Generally, my new specialists tell me that I am not sick.  All my illness includes the medications result of the wrong diagnostics!  These doctors want me to sue their colleagues.  For examples according of my former neurologist, Dr. XXXXXX, the epilepsy is finish but I must continue to take the medications for prevention.  The new neurologists refuse because the seizure medications cause the dizziness and destroy my lungs and my pancreas.  For my new cardiologists, I don't have blood clot, I can take warfarin to forewarn the stroke.  The ambulances dropped me XXXXXXXXXX hospital because of dizziness, checking, frequent falling down, small seizures and pains (chest, urology and back (bottom)).  I was almost 1 month and more at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX but they never help me: they did many scannings around my chest.  They saw the inflammation at one lung and pancreas problem.  According of the Commission of the doctors and pharmacists, all these problems result from seizure medications.  They wanted to discontinue the 3 seizure medications but Dr. XXXXXX refused ... the hospital discharged me 3 times (I went 2 times at XXXXXXXX's home for 1 or 2 days before returning to XXXXXXXXXX).  They also discontinue one diabetes medication, I continue to take the 2 insulins.  I was waking myself in the hospital with difficulty but I was going out by wheelchairs.  3 times I refused the discharges vainly.  The last time I entered at the emergency because of many falling downs at seizures at home.  After waiting more than 12 hours without treatment at emergency, they transfer me to the floor 6.  A nice physiotherapist started to help me to use special walker.  She refused the cane.  As she doesn't work during the weekend, she left quickly.  She told me that her colleague will be with me.  However, 3 hours after she left, they transfer me at my former department D4.  All the employees were surprise to see me again.  I did more than 1 week at D4 for nothing: No contact with the nurses/doctors/employees.  The employees developed good relationships with my visitor, XXXXXXXX.  Their conversation was all the times about me.  The hospital must not do that with the visitor to protec the patient intimacy.  The doctors forced me to sign an authorization to tell all my illness and problems to all the people i the world.  I am sick, I didn't understand what I was doing to sign that document.  In XXX, my neurologist during 20 years, Dr. XXXXXX, told me that according of XXXXXXXXXX I am violent, I\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I wear a Fitbit that track sleep and while in hospital I was getting less than 2.5 hours of sleep per night - due to noise. My pain was controlled and I could have slept if the nurses had been more considerate. Nurses talking and laughing loudly at their stations as well as when they were walking the hallways right outside your door.  Supply room doors that would slam shut each time a nurse would go in or out - this could be adjusted to close more quietly The carts that nursing used for the blood pressure and temperature taking all had castors that were loose and noisy so when they rolled it down the hallway it sounded like a train - again if maintained properly this would not be an issue. It was so noisy I closed the door to the room but each time the nurses came in to check on my room mate they would not close the door when they left - despite being asked many many times. It was not till I started to swear at them - as a last resort as it is not in my nature to treat people that way - that the door would be closed. Actually had a nurse twice loudly come into our room to empty something into the toilet flush it and leave without closing the door. That shouldn't happen for a number of different reasons including infection control. Speaking of infection control - never once did I see a nurse or doctor use hand sanitizer. Nor did I smell it being used. I work in health care and know how it should be used when entering or exiting a patient environment - and it was not. Nursing kept bringing medications that I no longer took. My pre-op was done in XXXX but my surgery was not till XXX so things had changed so I understand the confusion but nursing never corrected it so each day I would have to explain it to the nurse that was trying to get me to take meds. Some would say ' just tell me that you are refusing the med and that is fine' but they would never inform the pharmacy so that it wouldn't happen again. And the meds all came in a little cup mixed together so know which pills were the ones I should and should not take was not easy since they were different brand from what I was used to taking so hard to identify. It wasn't until my last day that a nurse finally said this should not be happening this should have been fixed at the beginning of the admission. Meds also were only dispensed on their schedule. I have taken blood pressure, heart meds and PPIs for years on a certain schedule and they would not accommodate that schedule   I received daily injections of blood thinner into my upper arm. On the date of my discharge I was told that I would have to learn to self inject as I would need to do this for the next few weeks at home. A nursing educator came by to show me how to inject and explained how and where the injections should be done - in either the stomach or the upper thigh. I told her that I had been receiving the injections in the upper arm and she stated that this was not correct and against policy. Now - having said all that .... there were some really exceptional nurses ( all during the day shift interestingly ) who were very kind and courteous and professional. it was the day nurse that finally addressed the medication issue.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I was shaking uncontrollably. There was concern about an epileptic episode and/or some apparent chest discomfort (although I don't recall that). Turned out I had a very high body temp (40C +) due to a bladder/urinary tract infection that apparently caused the shaking. Initial tests indicated no heart problems, confirmed by a cardiologist. I never did see a neurologist although a brain scan was performed. I never saw or discussed the results of the scan which I was quite interested in, to compare with a previous scan. Incidentally, there was no mention of the scan in my discharge document and I had to call the hospital to ensure that my family doctor would receive the scan result. The hospital determined that I should be admitted, although there was no bed available. I stayed overnight in a hallway, on the same emergency dept bed I had been in since arrival, a short stroll from a washroom that wasn't attended to while I was there.

EMS did an CCG and some test where some machine spewed out results on a long sheet of paper.  They seemed puzzled on the way to the hospital the ambulance had to be stopped in order to check the B/P + heart record.  On arrival, I was taken directly to cardiac unit where all nurse stated their concern/solutions.  They then made in whispered discussions until all of them were having a whispered conference in the hall outside a room with a bed where I had been left by EMS who were somewhere else waiting for instructions eventually the 'conference' moved into the bedroom someone suggested the put in the bed someone else said no if we do that she is ours.  Ageism could not have been more apparent.  I was moved to the only bed as the hall of the emergency dept where I was largely ignored by all the staff.  I think someone I eventually saw for a few minutes was a RN.  The rest appeared to be 'assistants' of some 'assistant' who said she would see me in a 'could of seconds' which lasted hours.  I was asked the same questions over and over which seemed to be intended to gain a description of intense pain.  Eventually I told the assistant that women often show quieter symptoms as men she yelled she knew that but the procedure continued.  It is possible that the ageism treatment in proving some mental problems the difference between the attitude and competence shown at XXXXXXXXXX and compared to my experience some years before at another XXXXXXX hospital was unbelievable.  There I was hooked up to a machine which constantly took my BP and heard rules and sounded when the machine could not keep up with the rapid changes.  A nurse was posted where she focused on the machine and me.  As a result, the other hospital arranged for me to consult a cardiac specialist. I arranged to see my family doctor who reported to my cardiac specialist . My blood pressure and heart rate were unstable for some days after leaving XXXXXXXXXX. I rested and gradually both returned to my normal.  The experience at XXXXXXXXXX was terrifying and I recommend that they seriously study how other XXXXXXX emergency hospitals procedure first with the speed of triage and second competence of staff to diagnose and treat.  I never saw the head of the department who signed the prescription for the medicine which I was to stop taking immediately if bruises and red spots appeared.  This was being screamed at me by the \"assistant\" who would not let me speak.  Doctors who actually listen to their patients have learned that the patients can provide vital information.

I see in the letter mailed to our house that I was welcome to complete it. My husband spent the initial portion of his stay in emergency and then in a short stay unit once he was admitted. During his initial stay in mid- XXXX, his symptoms weren't taken seriously and his infection was missed. He returned a week later, as requested, for a follow- up appointment to receive results from those initial tests. At this appointment, the doctor was still unsure what was wrong with him. Yet, less than 24 hours later, someone realized he was septic!! My husband ended up in emergency surgery - which he almost didn't survive - and then placed on life support. Prior to his initial emergency visit in mid- XXXX, he'd been healthy. We are completely dissatisfied with the level of care and attention to his symptoms that he received during the first admission, from both the Emergency team and the short stay team who saw him. We will be following up with that team in due time - right now, we are in shock and grief. My husband spent the remainder of the summer in the Critical Care Unit at both XXXXXXXXXX and then XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (he was transferred XXXXXXX). The level of care we received in the XXXXXXXXXX's CCU was second to none, definitely A+ and we have told them so. We've sent emails to Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, head of the CCU saying as much. We are grateful for all the life- saving and surgical work they did to try to save my husband's life. We speak highly of this medical team and know how hard they worked. The collegiality and expertise of the entire CCU team was impressive and made a big difference for my husband, myself, our kids and the rest of our family who was visiting. The other team who initially saw my husband dropped the ball in more ways than one. Massively disappointing to say the least. That's an understatement. Their miss ended up being fatal for my husband. He was only 41. The discrepancies and stark difference in the level of care my husband received in this two units made it difficult to complete this survey.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

My wife who had never seen me cry before (despite having had pains with slipped dis which required discotomy for I could not walk (XXXX etc and rupture.  Calcaneus ligament (XXXX)- causing pains 10/10) was so worried when dr. said she was sending me home.  My wife decided luckily to phone our daughter (XXX) - wake her up - and asked what we should do in this helpless situation - she spoke to Emerg physician and advised her to get a consult to medical internist.  Dr. heeded her insisted advice, consultant ordered xray, cat scan, EKG etc.  Remits -> blood test showed (unreadable) - strep (unreadable) - (high risk for bacterial endocarditis ca colon), Cat scan -> (unreadable) abscess & osteitis fragilis of neck with (unreadable) arthritis etc - I was end am still mad and upset about the callous and negligent treatment of Emerg dr.  How could she discharge a patient who was crying with excruciating pain??  With history of elevated temperature - subdued by Tylenol -> without proper investigations or consult???  What would have been the consequences of my untreated septicemia if my daughter had not been brave enough to give off to her??  When I received this survey - I hesitated to reply, for I still did not want to relive this horrible experience - and was actually in a state of denial.  I was sent home still with pains 7 to sometimes 10/10 - on penicillin IV days - for 6 weeks -> no one advised that same could cause diarrhea - preventable by taking probiotics (align or (unreadable) yogurt).  I did get the diarrhea - took probiotics as my daughter advised, which cured it.  While I was in hosp nurses were worried enough and advised me to request referral to pain clinic.  When I requested same to dr. he advised me that I did not need it!!!  With no explanation as to why not - despite my telling him slightest movement of neck muscles caused extreme 10/10 pains - and that pain medication they were prescribing was not working!!  At home I took double dose of pain medications then prescribed - for 1st time pain were relieved.  After 2 doses ((unreadable) were tolerable 4/10 - I needed no more steroids - took only Tylenol xtra strength!!)  Guess pain relief helped release muscle spasm in neck - due to fasciculitis - or several inflammation in muscles resulting from general septicemia??  Why am I writing this?  I hope Emerg physicians get better education, get reprimanded and (unreadable) for further patient (unreadable) course, and that doctors (consultants) opened (unreadable) more to listen to patients.

Some nurses do not tell anything about the medication why it is given to patient. But the nurses in Cardiac care D3 they did a fantastic job!\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I requested her assistance to use the bathroom it took almost half an hour and two calls later. I later advised her i was having a lot of pain and if she could check if i could get something she never bothered, she did not come back to me until about 4hrs later. I also told her again at about 1am i was having trouble sleeping and it there is anything i could be given she said not was prescribed for me. she never checked on me after that the entire night. lucky for me the nurse for the other patient assisted me twice to go to the bathroom. i never saw that nurse again until 5:30 am the next morning and it was at that time she gave me some pain meds, i did not sleep that night at all. she left without as much as introducing me to the nurse who took over from her on XXXXXXXXXXXXX. I really appreciated XXXX as she assisted me to go to the bathroom and brush my teeth and was more than happy to do so. I did not feel like I was a burden to her. and by this time the medication was already no longer helping she consulted with the doctors and was able to give me something to help with the pain.  she checked on me without me having to use the bell the way the other nurses I had prior to XXXXXXXXXXX, it is a pity I cannot remember her name as I'm not even sure she told me her name. I must say i was not alt all happy that i was never explained what exactly happened during my procedure that lead to my prolong stay in the hospital and I have to this date not give all the information I believe that I should have been given. I know something went wrong and it caused some complications, but as a grown adult with all my faculties intact I expected to be advised as to what happened and how to move forward, however it seemed no one was willing to provide and explanation. I was only told sorry it was so rough this is a one in million and don't usually happened but what exactly happened I still don't know, I believe each patient has the right to know what happened good or bad so they can make informed decisions. I would  also have liked my concerns to have been heard and acted upon, for while doctor are the expert only the patient knows EXACTLY how the feel and how much pain they are in and not to be treated as the next statistic or the norm as to what or how most people would react if they had the same procedure. Here I am with blood pooled in me not sure as to how long it will take to be re absorbed back into my body, when the pain and fatigue will go away when will the shooting pains stop. No one from the hospital ever contacted me to see if i was receiving the necessary care or have i had a follow up, I am not really sure what the procedure is but it needs a bit of tweaking. Might I make a suggestion that you provide some retraining for the nurse assigned to me on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and others you may have the same attitude as she had. I know that profession is not for everyone but since that was her choice patients already have a lot to deal with than to also have to worry their nurse do not want to assist them and may try to do things for themselves and cause more harm than good.  I would also want thank the staff that looked after me on XXXXXX, XX, the morning Nurse for the XXXX and XXXX on the XXXXXXXXX It was not the way I intended to spend my XXXXXXXXX but i will not soon forget how kind the were and how much they made the time there a little easier being away from my children and not certain what was going on. I would also want to thank all the doctors who cared for me all I ask is that patients do hear and do remember things that happened in the OR although you may think they do not. I know I started with one doctor and a second had to be called to assist and an ultrasound had to be used tond the artery during my procedure and I could hear more ml etc and someone saying she wouldn't remember a thing, i know a lot of confusion was happening and unanswered questions that may never be answered ut I am grateful for the care given to me only wished I was monitored more closely and advised of what happened immediately so that proper care could have been taken sooner. But I thank you for the opportunity to provide you feed back even though I do not believe it was random at all. I have provided to you to the best of my knowledge and and ability and hope this will have some impact on how patients are treated moving forward.  As scary and my experience was I hope lessons were learned and should it repeat itself better care would be taken. Patients do have a voice that needs to be heard so that you can provided them the very best of care.  Thank you kindest regards XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

She tried very hard not to let the last 2 weeks and, in particular, her discharged experience affect her responses  She does want to take this opportunity to voice a strong complaint against Dr XXXX, and the senior resident for XXXXXXXX, Dr XXXXXX  Dr XXXXXX completed that GIM rotation on XXXXXXXXXX  As her power of personal care and as her friend who was with her everyday during that admission she has asked me to provide some details regarding the period of time Dr XXXX, managed her care, since it is still so troubling to her.  My name is XXXXXXXXXXXX and my background is manager of home dialysis, diabetes & endurance at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (retired XXXXXXXXXXXX) XXXXXX was admitted on XXXXXXXXX to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, after 3 days in the emergency dept, to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, during that 6 week admission.  She stayed on 4 units - including XX  She was under the care of Dr XXXXXX, Dr XXXXXXX, Dr XXXXX and Dr XXXX, in that rotational order.  Nephrology was brought in as a consult during her admission to ICU and then again on XXXXXXXXX on the inpatient ward, due to the difficulty managing fluid removal.  Her case was complex due to renal failure, congestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation, made more challenging with SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone)  We both felt that the role of nephrology was critical during this admission as well as her XXXXXXXX ->XXXXXXXXX admission  During the last week of XXXXXXXXXXXXX the nephrology trainee told XXXXXX that they would be closely involved in her discharge planning  During late XXX/early XXX, Dr XXXXXX repeatedly told XXXXXX that she must get hersefl off oxygen.  However, when she would get up with physio, her O2 saturation would drop markedly and the physio told her to put back on  Similarly the nurses would put it back on when they came to do vital signs because her O2 saturation was low, even at rest  On XXXXXXXX the nephrology trainee told XXXXX that the nephrology team thought it might be possible for XXXXXX to be discharged home in 10-14 days  Her legs, thighs and fee were still very swollen and her chest sounds were gradually improving  The trainee said that  more fluid had to be removed and that she would need to be switched from intravenous lasix to oral lasix and observed for a few days on oral laxis to ensure she responded well (ie urine output)  So we were both surprised when Dr. XXXXXX cam in to see XXXXXX on XXXXXXXX to tell  her that he was discharging her home  Initially, she was pleased at the thought due to such a long time in hospital  Then, the idea of discharge home that day seemed a bit daunting, even though she had several outpatient appointments lined up (eg cardiology), given her condition, here legs were still very swollen, she was still on IV lasix 120 mg twice daily, she had a urinary catheter in place  Nonetheless, she trusted that \"the doctor knows best.\"  I went out to ask Dr XXXXXX about oxygen at home  After arguing with me that XXXXX had oxygen at home (which she has never had), he just snarled at me to just tell her to breathe more deeply then!  The XXXX coordinator came in and asked XXXXXX if she would lie the cardiac rapid response program to be re-initiated  XXXXXX had been on this program from XXXXXXXXX till XXXXXXXXX, and said she would be grateful to have that resumed  This was the best component of her discharge 'plan'.  The nephrology trainee came in to see XXXXXX and was shocked to hear she was being discharged home to see XXXXXX's oxygen saturation at 70 and she had \"crackles\" and poor air entry to her chest  XXXXXX was very weak and focused on breathing  She had had almost nothing to eat or drink since the previous evening  The XXnurse insisted she had to go back to hospital.  We got an ambulance right away, returning to XXXXXXXXXX 20 hrs post discharge  Since she was not asked to describe her XXXXXXXX ->XXXXXXXXX admission, I will not go into further detail about how Dr XXXXXX and Dr XXXX, treated her with absolute disrespect and inhumanity on XXXXXXXX  The obvious truth was that she never should have been discharged on XXXXX  As a retired nurse, i was truly ashamed of the medical profession as experienced by Dr XXXX and Dr XXXXXX  After 2 weeks under the care of the ICU team (Dr XXXXXXXXXXX) during 7 days in ER and 7 days in ICU and another 4 weeks on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, it was discovered that I was resistant to lasix and fortunately (again, thanks to nephrology) responded well to another diuretic (bumetanide) and lost about 40 lb of fluid  With the orange team, my discharge was very well planned (including physio etc.)  If it had not been for Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX's sensitivity and intervention to ensure I was not re-admitted to red team and if it were not for the competent care received with the physicians of the red team I would be considering legal action against Dr. XXXX and Dr XXXXXX on XXXXXX's behalf  Although XXXXXXXXXX will always be XXXXXX's first choice, there is great fear at the prospect of ever having to be under the care of either of these doctors  I have yet to send a complaint to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX regarding Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXXXX.  I have deliberately want to ensure I can reamin calm and objective  But there is no excuse for the horrifying and traumatic experience they caused XXXXXX and that I witnessed, both on XXXXX and XXXXX  I feel she is still carrying those emotional wounds with her  Thank you XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Response to & son on behalf of XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX Completed XXXXXXXXXXXX on my own, authorized & agree with XXXXXXXXXXXX's response to #50\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

The incision for interrogation implant and stitching up hurt as well (more than I thought it would). Blood did not stop 'oozing' from the incision site until the second interrogation four days later.

I was very pleased with him. Second compliment is Dr. XXXXX and Dr. XXXXXX. Both of them definitively did a good job and both knew what they were doing. Dr. XXXXX saw me before my surgery saw me right away after in recovery and saw me in the evening. I've never had anybody do that before and I've had a lot of surgeries done. Another compliment is for the one nurse XXXXXXXX. She was absolutely amazing. She worked the 3B and was always going above and beyond to make sure that we had all that we needed; enough pain medication and that we stayed hydrated and she reassured us. She was just phenomenal and I was happy that she was on duty for the 3 days until the bad nurse came. The hospital needs an uplift and we need a second hospital because we support all of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX area and there is a need for a second hospital in the city especially for urgent care. For example if someone has a heart attack at one end of the city they have to travel across the city to get to the hospital. With another hospital in the city it could cut down on wait times and reduce the hallway care. Hallway care is dangerous for low immune people and hallway care needs to be eliminated.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

Then I was transferred to another section. I was in A transferred to B and informed that if an ER DR did not admit me that a specialist would admit me. So I waited and there was a shift change. I asked the new nurse if I was admitted and she said yes and proceeded medication orally. I got upset because at that point I explained to her what I had been previously told. She said that she was not aware of that and that the admitting dr had not ordered that intravenous that I was told that I would be getting. Because I was at risk of a heart attack. I was in kidney failure and at risk of a heart attack. I mentioned my specialist name and I also questioned why I would be admitted??? I could take oral med at home??? and they were testing my blood only once a day. So in my mind I thought why would I occupy a bed??? I can take oral med and I could do this at home. Although the nurse ... I was upset and then the nurse became a little bit hostile??? a little negative??? she kinda challenged me. And within half an hour ... A was transferred ... and within 15 to 20 minutes ... they must have called a specialist??? she inserted an intravenous line. I was moved to a hospital ward to a bed and in the ward I was given the medication intravenously and the oral med was stopped. Now the one thing I???ll say up front ... is the food in the hospital is disgusting. My husband brought my food. it's a total waste of money with the food that they serve to patients. Because of the uniqueness of my disease and my condition ... I found everyone there very professional and very kind??? everyone encountered was excellent ... although I'm considered a senior ... I consider myself a young senior. The ward I was in??? most of the pts were older and had serious issues ... I felt I wasn't getting any rest. I was getting all the care I needed but I felt I was not getting all the rest I needed. I found that the nurses spent a lot of time running and dealing with these seniors ... a lot of other duties that the nurses had to perform in addition to the nursing duties. The only other thing ... my admission was really rapid??? probably because I got upset ... when finally in bed??? the phone rang ... someone from bookkeeping asked if I had insurance ... it was a little upsetting ... if I didn't are they going to move me? I've never heard of anyone being moved once they???re in a hospital bed ... I'm not sure if this was something missed in ER??? they never phoned the lady beside me??? and it seemed odd that they would ask me. Was it because I was in a semi private room. I'm not sure if that's their protocol??? it was a little unnerving ... it was not that I didn't have insurance??? I did. I was there when my neighbor came in??? and she was not asked. One more thing ... in the time I was there??? almost two weeks. I had 14 nurses??? I found that to be a lot of different people I had to interact with over a short period of time. I am very good at communicating ... however that's 14 individuals I had to interact with in a short period. Someone with dementia or memory problems??? that's a large number of individuals??? everybody is unique. I realize with the shift work and everything ??? this could just be my bad luck. The only other thing is this hospital has to be expanded??? it's not nearly big enough for the aging population of XXXXXXXXXXX and its region.

It was great. This time with covid it was not the same. Not as a organized. Food was so bad had to put my foot down. If you want to get people better they need nutrition. The choices they made were not good. I ask for more sometimes. You are taking pills I am diabetic and you are giving me stuff that make it off the charts. Oatmeal in the morning dog would not eat it. Some of the staff was patience and took their time in the care. Some would talk a little bit. Doctors were very well spoken straight and given me the facts to understand. When you call for them they say we are sending them but no one shows up for an hour. I ask for water then they forget. 12-14 days were there saw a lot of forgetfulness don't want to keep bugging them. Not allowed to go out and get yourself. Sometime trays not picked up until the next morning. Some days were a challenge. Shocking part bother me the most. Toothbrush took 2 days to get a toothbrush. and It was a one time thing and liquid. I asked for my stuff from home that was an arm and leg to get a back. Can I get a toothbrush I will pay for it. I was taking pills and I was not feeling well.

Is there anything else you would like to share about your hospital stay? Yes. About my experience at the Emergency Department of the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. On XXXXXXXXXXXX around 7:30 PM I was rushed to this Emergency waiting room by paramedics, who were called to my home due to my severe pain in the right shoulder and back and I was sweating profusely too. This happened 20 days after my first open heart surgery on XXXXXXXXXXX for replacement of Aortic Valve and a small by-pass surgery. The paramedic, who came with me in the van, put me in a wheelchair and went to the Emergency Registration Desk and explained my health condition, showed my health card, mentioned about my XXXXXXXXXXX open-heart surgery too, and then only left me in the waiting room. In spite of these information given to the staff before, there was more than one hour delay in treating me. My husband asked few times to look into my case, but the staff at the registration desk keep saying, that nurses are busy or not available etc. reasons. After almost 50 min. at the Emergency waiting room, I suddenly had another wave of pain and something passed through my right head, my head slumped and became almost unconscious. Fortunately my husband noticed my condition and saw my body jerking and he pushed my wheel chair to the nursing station and request some medical treatment immediately. Then only I was rushed inside and they started treatment and said to my husband that I am in stable condition after one hour. I stayed in the EMergency ward bed for 2 days and then moved to cardiac ward bed. After some tests the cardiac surgeon decided to do second open heart surgery to remove the big blood clot that was pressing on the heart on XXXXXXXXXXXX - This clot happened due to blood oozing out after few stitches came off from the area where they did the first by-pass stitches. Two days after I came back to my ward bed, the surgeon came in and explained the reason and need for 2nd open heart surgery. He said I am so lucky to be alive today, another 3 - 5 mins. delay at the emergency would have killed me. That was a shocking news to me. This should not happen to any other patient who come to the Emergency room at the hospital in the future. Please take some positive action and prioritize patients immediate need.

During her stay at this unit in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, our family felt that there was a lack of attention for my grandma, especially given her condition. As a family, we felt helpless because we were not informed of her situation or status. When we asked the nurse that was on duty, it felt that she was annoyed and agitated by our questions when we were only concerned about our grandmother's health and condition. The nurse was very rough and not mindful of the way she was conducting herself when carrying out procedures to her patient and inconsiderate of the feelings of the distressed family members. Unlike her normal practice, she concealed her name badge in her uniform and erased her name from the whiteboard. Given the two family member per visit rule in this unit, I was left with my cousin to look after my grandmother. We didn't see the nurse on duty attending to our grandmother for a very long time, so I went to the nurse station to ask our nurse to check up on my grandmother because she started to feel uncomfortable. Our nurse was rude and dismissive, and the other nurses at the station gave false reassurance that everything is being monitored appropriately, as to not be bothered by further questions of their practice. That is when we noticed something was wrong. My grandmother fell into cardiac arrest and my cousin was screaming for help in the unit, but the nurses weren't quick to react as if we were just making ruckus. Until they realized there was a serious situation, and that is when they issue a code alert. Our nurse performed CPR on my grandmother with immense force on her chest that later caused much pain and stress. Our family believes that if it wasn't for the nurse's negligence, our grandmother may not have fallen to this state of cardiac arrest, in which our grandmother feels more pain now than before she was admitted to the hospital. Throughout this experience, we all felt that the nurse was dismissive, disrespectful, and irresponsible, which made us conclude that this nurse should not be practicing if she doesn't have the heart to do so. This is the reason why we are filing a complaint against the nurse; however, we are unable to track her full name. We heard her name is 'XXXX' based on the nurses.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "Yes"}

I visited your hospital because I had excruciating pain in the calf of my left leg. I was worried that I had a blood clot. My first visit was for a total of 4 hours. The doctor was excellent and very professional. I was asked to return the following day to have an ultrasound test done because the department closed at 5:00 PM. I arrived the following day for my ultrasound appointment at the scheduled time (noon). Then I was asked to return to the emergency department to wait for my results. The emergency room was filled to capability with people coming in and waiting to see a doctor. I was almost ready to leave but finally, seven hours later my name was called to see the doctor. If I may, I'd like to offer a couple of suggestions ... I'm certainly not a regular at an emergency department but if people must spend numerous hours waiting to see a doctor, perhaps a vending machine could be available in the emergency waiting area. Access to a simple refreshment would most definitely ease some of the stress and offer a few minutes of comfort. Also, if a patient is simply waiting for results (ex. ultrasound) from a test, perhaps the patients could remain in the department where the test was done or could return home and wait for a call. The waiting area in the emergency department was so jam-packed that at one point there was no place to sit. As well, we were instructed by the registration nurse that we not leave or head outside. As you know, Covid is a real concern and I was surprised at how many people were allowed in the waiting area. Some chairs were marked off to ensure that people did not sit beside one another but standing beside you is the same thing. Overall, I was very satisfied with the care I received. However, I was concerned at how many hours people were expected to wait to see a doctor. While waiting for my ultrasound results, there were emergency ambulances that arrived with cardiac arrest patients and pushed back the wait time for everyone sitting in the waiting area. I also observed a lady in great mental distress and in need of immediate care, which she received. It was exhausting to watch and a very stressful day. I praise the medical staff on the front lines - job well done! But, for us regular folks - I sure wish I had not needed to visit an emergency department that day. I hope my suggestions are helpful. I believe that the patients that visit your emergency department and working staff would appreciate the changes. Take good care!\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I was discharged right after her shift had ended and the nurse I had at discharge had to explain everything to me. Discharge nurse was very straightforward and explained everything that I felt should have been explained to me before discharge so I didn't have to rush to fill out paperwork and try to prepare my baby and myself to head home from the hospital. Communication seemed to lack in the postpartum unit, as I was mistaken for a vaginal delivery when I had a caesarean. My doctor was always up to date on my care and advocated for my health, pain relief and general wellbeing. Postpartum nurse missed a test for my baby and I ended having to ask when it was going to be done (lack of communication from other nurses in the unit). My doctor explained the morning after surgery what my abilities were after surgery, next steps in healing and just checking in on my overall wellbeing. Doctor re-explained at discharge what my abilities after surgery were and what I could not do. I was not told I had severe preeclampsia until after surgery (I was aware of high blood pressure and a few other symptoms). I tried breastfeeding in hospital and every nurse had a different way of trying to help to feed which I found to be confusing.

With all the noise and masks etc., I wasn't able to understand what the diagnosis was, but thought I could ask on the phone when they called at home.

I called ER the next day, XXXXXX, but his chart had been sent to Health Records, talked to his family dr's office on XXXXXX and finally got an answer on XXXXXXXX. Now I'm sure that the dr felt she had explained everything clearly (not blaming her), but I really feel someone should have called to say he was coming home. There have been other incidents, the worst one being sent home with nothing on from the T-shirt down, wrapped in a blanket ... not even diaper.

The nurses and doctors were great. I had to stay a second night because my baby had jaundice. Initially we were told the baby would go to the nursery and be under the blue light in a incubator. The nursery ended up being full so we were moved to paediatrics and the incubator was in my room. The Ped's nurse on days was great, she explained everything and was very kind (which meant a lot considering I was a new mom). The night shift was a different experience. There seemed to be a lack of communication between the nurses. At one point we were told to just shut the alarm off on the machine that was monitoring the baby's vitals. I told the nurse I was not comfortable with that. If the alarm went off - I thought they should check on her. We were also told to leave the door open because the temperature at one point was too high. The day shift nurse had said to NEVER walk away with the door open. During our baby's time in the incubator they would rotate her. When the nurse wanted to put our baby on her stomach during the night, I explained that I was not comfortable with that as I had asked if they can hear the alarm at the desk and she said no. I knew I was exhausted and wasn't sure I would wake up. At the bottom of the machine it said that the machine was out of paper and that it wasn't recording. I am not a health care professional by an means, but it does not sit well with me that if something was to go wrong - there was no record of it. I have thought about the treatment we received on our second night in the hospital and it was unacceptable. Initially I thought maybe I was being hormonal after having a baby, but looking back now I still think it was unacceptable. I have also thought maybe they were short staffed that night, etc - whatever the reason maybe, it would have went along way to explain that. They could of all been having a bad shift, I don't know but after our second night there, we couldn't get out of there fast enough. So, I wouldn't recommend XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for labour and delivery. If my baby for some reason had to be admitted - I would choose another hospital and if we had to be in XXXXXX and we by chance had the same ped's nurses, I would request a different nurse.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Anytime I've had any other medical issues such as going to the emergency department, I've had no problems. But to be honest, if and when I have my second child, I most likely WILL NOT be delivering at XXXXXXXXX hospital. The hospital was dirty, old, and some (not all) of the nurses were rude!!! Not helpful at all. And when I would ask a question it's like I was being a bother, but this was my first child and like any new mom, we have questions that would hope to be answered! I hope you work on your staff and improvement of the hospital in general. Also, the temperature in our room was horrible and myself and newborn got sick when we left the hospital. We asked several times to adjust the blowing of the air in our room And it was never adjusted to our liking ... disappointed XXXXXXXXX!!\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

Instead they are there huddled together chatting or doing their own thing and ignoring me as I am screaming in pain. My daughter brought all the drugs I was discharged with post op and had to beg a nurse for me to have one for the pain. Finally a nice nurse said yes go ahead. I eventually got admitted where I stayed for 8 days in the neurological orthopaedic floor on 5. I received excellent care there. They were finally able to manage the pain after five days.

She lectured me on how much other work she had to do & cannot attend to these details. Very unacceptable!  Especially since there was a lot of talk and laughter at the nurses' station. The second nurse (all I remember is that she was pregnant) refused to get me water & told me where to go to get it - with no feeling in my hands, very difficult to do. The morning nurse the next day was wonderful and very efficient. Knowing  my condition, she automatically opened everything on the breakfast tray, and followed up with all meds and actions exactly as she told me she would. All other experiences were very good, i.e., in OR and post-op. Very good care there! Doctors were very attentive, would listen and explain all my questions. - Also, the first two nurses would drop things on the floor and never pick them up. The room was cleaned only once near the end of my stay.  A lot of garbage was on the floor. The rest of my experience at the hospital was very good but those two nurses were very lazy and unaccommodating.

Once I was admitted into see the nurses and doctors, relief came very quickly and I was comforted feeling I was receiving excellent care. All of the nursing staff were excellent. The doctors that reviewed my case were very thorough in their investigation, communicated clearly what the issue was and left me feeling I was fortunate to be getting care from a very professional organization.

XXXXX, also a nurse in neurosurgery, was somehow able to make me feel like a normal person again. It felt like I knew XXXXX for ages, and she was just a friend helping another friend go through back surgery. The worst experience was by far the argument over my antidepressants. Now I can not blame the doctors who tried to explain all the details about post surgery stuffs. I just ain't smart enough to get it all, but the nurses covered after the fact. This argument though was about the change in dose for my antidepressants. I had asked the Nurse Practitioner if she had spoken to my psychiatrist... her reply was 'does he have admitting privileges here?' ... NO... that wasn't the point... her job was to fix my back... not mess with my head... that was my psychiatrists job... and she stepped out of bounds, and did it in a snotty way. Again this would have been better served coming from someone in Psych. But I would think someone from Psych would give my own doctor some professional courtesy.

Then I spoke with a human after. They were opened 24h. To clarify I said so if I have to go in & needed xray would they be opened later. I was reassured they were opened & someone would be there if it was determined I needed to go as I wasn't dr. so she said again 24/7 & would put me through to the emerge so they could confirm it. So I retold my story again & was reassured by nurse (but turned out to be the person that gets all info & gives the papers & hand tags that spoke to me & she gave me the wrong info as I had explained what happened & I didn't want to have to go back if no xray dept was available (saw her the next day & she said it was her). So next person in emerge said same thing - yep xray open 24 hrs & if need to go someone would be available & I explained I called so I didn't want to have to go back & have to wait around AGAIN! Then later on went in so hubby had to drive me in and the triage nurse was very rude not courteous but we put up with her. She told us we just missed it as they closed 15 mins prior to our getting there. Of course I was upset because then I had to go back to the hosp. again which was what I was trying to avoid in the 1st place!! I explained to her that I called the xray dept & got no answer so ended speaking with switchboard (?) & she gave me the wrong info even though I explained about calling xray dept. & got no answer & wanted to know when they would be opened to avoid a return drive to the hosp! When I did go to triage she explained they don't open 24 hrs & I explained what I had been told she said they only opened till 11:30 p.m. not 24 rs or have any xray tech on call unless life or death & doctor told me that as well. He was quite good & respectful the 1st doctor I saw. It's always the nurses who are usually rude & disrespectful! So of course I saw the doctor & he checked my arm/shoulder injury & said needed xrays so to call first thing as asked what time & if I had to go through the whole scenario again he just said to go see them 1st thing. Sure enough next morning I had to sit & wait for triage. After I went to xray & waited & waited for someone to show up I even went looking for someone! Then finally got the xrays & they said to do the registration thing again & wait for the xrays. Which is why I hate the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX as the give you the wrong info & you wait & wait & then find out you do the wrong things after waiting!! So I will not be supporting the hospital there when go to XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX or XXXXXX!! Both doctors & lab tech I saw were nice but everyone else was a real pain! They need sensitivity despite their work load!! If they working longer then hire more people & provide customer service training!! Maybe more nurse practitioners!! Now to continue ... on the second day after I had to go back to emerge & register & sit & wait for results again & waited in wrong area again then found out they had the xrays & should have gone to register then wait in the emerge waiting room! So took another four hrs to wait. I did go to the nurses to find out how much longer & they said they had to wait for radiologist to read it (xrays) from XXXXXX to send it & give info & they didn't know when that would be. Again nurses - it's wait-wait-wait -> After waiting a long while again -> my daughter went out 2x in this waiting game!! -> and so I went back into the nurses & asked again - any news - as it was getting tiring & in pain - pills weren't helping -> This time while being told no news a doctor stepped up & said waiting on news from xray radiologist from XXXXXX - he said he could read xrays & nurses looked at him. Then one of them got up as she had been doing some paperwork & no doubt, after she went by him - to say wait for XXXXXX so again I sat & waited & waited! en finally that same doctor called me and then explained & rechecked my shoulder that it wasn't dislocated but that it showed no fractures (which was a relief cause it felt like it) but that I had separated the ligament from my ACV or something like that (the amaro clavicular bone?) so I could put it in a sling & would need physio - so I asked for a prescription & got one & he again explained better what I had done to my shoulder. He was nice & so was the first who took the time to test the arm & said I definitely needed xray on it & didn't dislocate it. 2nd doctor said also wasn't dislocated nor fractured (so happy to hear that part!). Now you know the full story & this needs to be given tot he hospital to be read do not put it in your own words! Copy it as is & pass the darn thing on so they can improve their service & having only 1 doctor one in evening is ridiculous as I must admit the first time I went in I didn't have a long time to wait to see him but the next day ... well a different story & surprisingly emerge waiting room was not as full but they did 1 person before me after he came after me! Yep still going - so glad you sent a survey out! & thank you for this!\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "No"}

It's not easy seeing your child sick like that and especially when they are so young, but having the staff we had made a bad situation as best as it could be so for that I will always be extremely grateful. I've honestly never had as good a hospital experience as I did while we were there. We had Dr. XXXXXXXXX and he was a great doctor. He has even done a phone consult afterwards which really helped ease my mind. Definitely not the norm for a doctor to be willing to phone a patients parent. In addition his receptionist has been great. A huge hug goes out to the 6th floor staff and Dr. XXXXXXXXX!! One comment I do have is that while being admitted into emerge the nurse that collected our information and also treated my daughter was very short and it was very obvious she didn't really care to listen to us as the concerned parents. One nurse even admitted they were using new needles and didn't feel comfortable 'learning' on such a small baby, but the nurse we had issues with said 'oh I don't have problems' and proceeded to attempt to put the IV in with no success. Six tries later I nicely asked for a NICU nurse to come down to put in the IV (which they got with one attempt) and this was on the advice of a family friend who works at the hospital to not let them continue to attempt her IV in case they need the veins for possible later treatment depending on what the test results came back with. I wished we would have gotten her name because I would have complained about how rude, uninterested she was in listening to us when we were getting admitted by her as well as how she was so cold about learning your new IV needle on such a small baby like it was nothing. I will say she was working around noon in emerge on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and she was possibly oriental origin with black straight shoulder blade length hair and average to small frame. Personally I feel especially working with kids/infants the staff need to really be in tuned to listening to the parents when they are the voices of so many kids and the parents are stressed out and upset as it is, we don't need someone who seems to not have any warmth or concern for the situation that has brought the family in. I'm just glad our experience at all times on the 6th floor was as incredible as it was as it made up for the not the most impressive nurse in emerge.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

On the other hand, my stay on the XXX floor was one of the worst experiences I have yet to have. All but 3 nurses were rude, non-empathetic, never keep me informed about what was going on or when I would be seen by a doctor. No one EVER checked on me, came when I buzzed, or checked to see if I ate anything on any given day. Most of the patient were elderly waiting for chronic care, I will NEVER allow any of my family members to stay on that floor. I can hear how rude the nurses were with the patients in a close perimeter to me, the way they talk to them is not acceptable whatsoever. My very close friend has already spoken to patient relations in hopes that these issues would be addressed. Understandably, these nurses are busy, but this is the career path they chose and they should be treating patients with dignity and respect. I actually had a nurse come into my room and pass my sister a cup of pills. She gave them to me and I didn't even know what two of them were. My aunt went to the nurses station to ask why they did give them directly to me, only to be treated will dis-respect. Such a shame really. The visitors I did have that were from the city will no longer attend that hospital for care, they now drive to another XXX location. The doctors on the other hand were very respectful and when I did see them, they were very polite, especially Dr. XXXXXX.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

I am not one to complain but I was in very much pain and it seemed to be an eternity before anyone could really help me. Dr. XXXXXX was very professional, courteous, and helpful when I finally did see a doctor. I was very impressed with him. He even called me at home a few days later to see how I was doing! That was appreciated very much. The ER department needs to be expanded, given more funds, and more access of doctors and nurses to provide prompt treatment. I realize budgets are strained to the limit, governments are cutting back but surely XXX deserves to be at the top of its game in providing health care in a timely manner that meets the needs and dignity of patients. Our civic leaders and local XXX should be more proactive and work together in making this happen. XXX can't do this alone.

I described my experience with him to my regular doc. She read other comments made by pts experience in the E.R. with this guy. The words used by other pts. were almost identical to mine. He has a well-estbalished reputation for being a world-class jerk who needs discipline or better still removed from that job. I was very upset with my experience with him I was always polite + courteous with all the staff - no one deserves that kind of bad behavior Health card XXXXXXXXXXXXXX You can quote me on this anytime Sincerely XXXXXXXXXXXXX From Attachment - XXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Emergency Dept. Visit XXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXX 10:02 AM XXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hello. I decided to write to you or to enhance my remarks that I made in the questionnaire. I realized that I had omitted some of my experience with Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX. Initially I had no difficulty with my experience in the ER. I left feeling that the nurses & supporting staff do an amazing job under very, very difficult conditions. All have my utmost respect & voice my opinion every chance I get. However, it wasn't until Dr. XXXXX arrived to what I had hoped for to help me understand what was going on & why I felt so sick. I was told by my GP & by the doctor at the XXXXX to covid clinic that I looked ill. Both seemed to feel the need for me to be re-hydrated &/to go the the XXX which I did. That the hydration didn't happen was not the problem. The difficulty lay entirely with Dr. XXXXX. He asked if I had given a urine sample. I said I had a few days earlier but didn't have the results He then demanded to know if I had given the sample midstream. \"Did you give it midstream? Do you know what that means? Do you know why you're supposed to give it mid-stream??\" I responded with no, I hadn't as no-one reminded me at the time & let it go but on-edge. Then he stated that he didn't think my liver was enlarged or that I probably didn't have a kidney infection (I had been on different antibiotics for over two week(s) Then he wanted me to show him where my back hurt. I tried to point out the area but I wasn't experiencing much pain at the time. He then accused me of pointing to my side & not my back. There's no pain. Then he thumped on my back really hard where the pain was. Three times. It hurt & I said so. The feeling I got from him was described by myself on the questionnaire. He was shockingly bad at what he was doing. I explained that I had spoken to another doc about his behaviour. She said he sounds & acts like someone with difficulty dealing with ageism which is another pandemic out there in the world. She then found other pts. experiences identical to mine. Word for word. He was disrespectful, rude, obnoxious, condescending, sarcastic, belligerent, believing he is the hot-doc in the E.R. & can behave any way he wants. I did another urine test the results of which took two days. He said that that probably won't find anything but someone will call. He put me on some antibiotic in the meantime. I got a call & was told I had e-colli & needed penicillin. When I was talking to the nurse I complained about XXXXX behavior. She said her job is to listen. I thanked her for doing so & that I appreciated it. How incompetent & useless is this guy? And possibly dangerous because of his attitude that he's always right & the pt. knows nothing. That is your problem. Keeping him there w/o student level supervision creates a huge imbalance & weakness in the system you so carefully maintain. He needs to be reined in. He thinks he can say & do whatever he wants w/o jeopardy. Something serious could happen. Thank you for listening. I've had enough experience in the health care system dealing with some difficult situations. As I stated earlier the rest of the staff were terrific & wanted to belpful. The young woman with the endless task of cleaning & disinfecting was very helpful in pointing out the ice machine. With a smile, no less. I hope this is helpful. I try to be optimistic about doing the right thing for the right reasons. Sincerely, XXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "No"}

It looked as though the hospital was changing staff from day staff to night staff and it appeared there was insufficient night staff scheduled getting answers, support, food, information for caregivers visiting was sadly very scarce.  I was in stable condition and hence by default felt was given less attention or information than others in the ward.  A suggestion would include examining the patient experience based on when they are wheeled to their room.  This is where most of the confusion and questions start.  Once day staff started the next day, the patient experience was markedly different and helpful.  Questions that can be pre-answered by medical staff for personal visiting care givers could include - Can the patient eat or drink? - Should they walk on their own? - Where can we get food after 7pm? - What can patient expect throughout the night?\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient?

It's quite traumatic becoming aware of pain during the process and yet unable to move or stop what is happening....kinda frozen. The only problem this time was the Anesthetist was quite late and I was made to wait much longer until he arrived. Just not having him there, concerned me that I might not be sedated after all. But for the most part of the procedure I was unaware of what transpired.....until later near the end when I started to feel the pain and I moaned.....instead of yelling out loud! Side note: as time goes on and I experience these procedures over and over again, I get more anxious knowing the outcome and not wanting to endure the procedure again. My doctor, Dr. XXXXX, was very empathetic to my plight and he is such a compassionate and caring physician! He has always treated me with dignity and respect and I admire his caring ways.

Totally different from my experience with my mother a few months earlier. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Canadian Patient Experience Survey I received and completed the recent Canadian Patient Experience Survey. My experience was very good, but I need to share the experience with my mother a few months earlier. My mother was XX, feel and broke her hip. Surgery went fine, but things quickly deteriorated. My mother's first language was not English, she was nearly deaf and in the early stages of dementia. Needless to say, with the drugs, communication problem etc. she would not appear very cooperative,. After only one day, my impression was that the staff looked at her and made the decision to send her back to the nursing home and put her in palliative care. She was taking up a valuable hospital bed. Having broken her other hip 6 years earlier, the family knew that she would hallucinate for 2-3 days, and would not be herself. The family was not sure how she would respond to therapy, but she did quite well with time. Her treatment during that stay was good, and we had something to compare the recent stay to. That is why I was shocked to see such poor care/attitude this time around. She was restrained in her bed and we accepted that she needed to be. We spoke to one nurse and mentioned that her nursing home ahd a 'no restraint' policy. The nurse response was 'find another nursing home' Hospital staff wanted my mother out of the hospital within 48 hrs of her operation. They communicated with the nursing home to arrange a transfer. The information that they provided to the nursing home was very limited and selective. Eventually the nursing home staff told the hospital staff that the home was not equipped to take care of her ie. the medication, I's restraints etc. The hospital reluctantly agreed. The transfer waited a few more days for my mother to go off the medications. This at least allowed us the time to see if she was being 'uncooperative' because of her medications (hallucinations), and to make an informative decision. In summary I was left with the following impression. \"She's old, not cooperating (ignoring the fact that she didn't understand and could be hallucinating), she is reaching her expected hospital stay time, we can use the bed for another patient. let's get her out of here and have someone else look after her.\" I realize that the staff couldn't do very much with her, but the general attitude was horrendous and not acceptable to me. This was totally opposite to her first experience my recent experience.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "No"}

I was given treatment for it but was not told if it looked infected or not, I also wasn't given a bandage for it after I'd removed the one I came in with for the examination - both minor things that I would have preferred but aren't critical. What I did think was odd was that no one asked if I was okay. Luckily I have my own mental health supports in the community, but no one asked about the state of my mental health or did a risk assessment. Someone in my situation could have gone to an emergency room with this type of injury as a cry for help. I understand that hospital resources for mental health are limited but a nurse could do a brief suicidal risk assessment at a minimum. As someone whose mother committed suicide while on the wait list for psychological help at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, I strongly feel that hospitals have a responsibility to treat mental health as well as physical health when there is an obvious \"red flag\" for mental health issues such as a self harm injury. They didn't ask even ask if it was the first time that I had ever done something like this - there were zero check-ins around the cause of my injury. I would be grateful, for my self and all those with mental health issues, if a risk assessment could be incorporated into emergency room standard of care.

A sponge was left inside me. It was caught during final count which I was very thankful for however my husband was left waiting outside the OR (he was removed because my spinal wore off during surgery) he was receiving no updates while we were waiting for x-ray to determine if the sponge was in fact inside me. He saw people going in and out of the room and was standing there with our new baby but had no clue what was happening. Finally I asked if someone had updated him because it had been a long time and the anesthetist went to provide him with an update. The staff were all communicating with each other around me in whispered voices. It appeared from my perspective very secretive instead of including me. the anesthetist was the only person speaking to me and making me feel more comfortable. The act of hiding it from me was what was making me uncomfortable. If there had been full disclosure and communication the situation would have been less stressful for me. Following the incident I felt like I was being avoided like the plague. As if the staff were worried I was going to sue. The manager of the floor who was very much involved in the situation never talked to my husband or I. The anesthetist apologized immediately following the incident when i had woken up. He was the only one. I never saw any of the other staff that were involved till my nurse (who told me she would be by to see me soon) popped her head in at 7 pm. My c - section had been at 8 am. The surgeon came by my room at the end of the day and apologized for the way things were conducted which I appreciated. The fact is that things happen we are all human. I was not angry that it happened, I was not happy that after the c - section I had to be put to sleep to open back up and retrieve the sponge but I was not angry. What made me uncomfortable was that instead of discussing it with me and being forthcoming with the situation it felt all very hush hush and then swept under the rug. I think that in this situation the floor manager or lead OR nurse could have informed my husband what was going on as she was going in and out of the OR. It wasn't an emergent situation we were left waiting around for a long time. I should have been approached after the fact or even when I was waiting on the table to provide me with information. This simple act would have made me feel better about the situation.\"\n\nWas this comment written by a heart patient? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" only.", "output": "No"}

Just prior to Covid 19, my wife had many regular visits that lasted hours. Secondly, I reserved judgement on question 30 and 31 based on the following ... a lack of professional discretion in prescribing. I would like to mention that I was unhappy with a prescription of one of the two antibiotics for which the side effects were serious and seemed to match conditions already being experienced. This information was only available after having purchased the medication from a pharmacy by way of the printed word provided by the pharmacy that accompanied the medication. The medication was a strong antibiotic called Sandoz-Levofloxacin The warning related to peripheral neuropathy ... serious and permanent damage to tendons and nervous system problems. I never took the medication because it described symptoms I suffered for years. I am concerned and disturbed that doctors would prescribe such risk taking medication so readily as only a preventative measure to infection. Googled information revealed that this grouping of quinolone antibiotics has been know to cause nerve damage. Developed by Bayer in XXXX, reports began surfacing through the XXXXXXXX about the damages caused to nervous system. The FDA published warnings in XXXXbut not until XXXX did the FDA require \"boxed warnings\" ... then strengthening the warning in XXXX that doctors should not prescribe except as a last resort. And yet this class of antibiotics continues as a most prescribed medication. I am following up my medical history to check past prescription of this malevolent medicine with interest into how many others have had life changing issues, with the hope of forcing changes through legal prosecution.
