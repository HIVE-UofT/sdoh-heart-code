Sphygmomanometer,An instrument used to measure blood pressure.
Stem cells,"Special cells in the body that are able to transform into other cells. It is possible for stem cells to transform into heart cells, nerve cells, or other cells of the body, possibly helping to improve the function of failing organs, including the heart."
STEMI,ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. The more severe form of the 2 types of heart attack. See also NSTEMI. A STEMI produces a characteristic elevation in the ST segment on an electrocardiogram.
Stent,"A device made of expandable, metal mesh that is placed (by using a balloon catheter) at the site of a narrowing artery. The stent is then expanded and left in place to keep the artery open."
Stenosis,"The narrowing or constriction of an opening, such as a blood vessel or heart valve."
Stethoscope,An instrument for listening to sounds within the body.
Stokes-Adams disease,"Also called third-degree heart block; a condition that happens when the impulses that pace your heartbeat do not reach the lower chambers of your heart (the ventricles). To make up for this, the ventricles use their own “backup” pacemaker with its slower rate. This rhythm can cause severe dizziness or fainting and can lead to heart failure or death."
Streptococcal infection (“strep” infection),"An infection, usually in the throat, resulting from the presence of streptococcus bacteria."
Streptokinase,A clot-dissolving medicine used to treat heart attack patients.
Sternum,The breastbone.
Stress,"Bodily or mental tension resulting from physical, chemical, or emotional factors. Stress can refer to physical exertion as well as mental anxiety."
Stroke,"A sudden disruption of blood flow to the brain, either by a clot or a leak in a blood vessel."
Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Bleeding from a blood vessel on the surface of the brain into the space between the brain and the skull.
Subclavian arteries,Two major arteries (right and left) that receive blood from the aortic arch and supply it to the arms.
Sudden death,"Death that occurs unexpectedly and instantaneously or shortly after the onset of symptoms. The most common underlying reason for patients dying suddenly is cardiovascular disease, in particular coronary heart disease."
Superior vena cava,The large vein that returns blood from the head and arms to the heart.
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT),A regular rapid heart rate (150-250 beats per minute) that is caused by events triggered in areas above the heart’s lower chambers (the ventricles); see also paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).
Syncope,"A temporary, insufficient blood supply to the brain which causes a loss of consciousness. Usually caused by a serious arrhythmia."
Systolic blood pressure,The highest blood pressure measured in the arteries. It occurs when the heart contracts with each heartbeat.
Tachycardia,"Accelerated beating of the heart. Paroxysmal tachycardia is a particular form of rapid heart action, occurring in seizures that may last from a few seconds to several days."
Tachypnea,Rapid breathing.
Tamponade,Also called cardiac tamponade. A condition in which the heart is compressed or constricted because of a large amount of fluid or blood in the space between the heart muscle and the sac that surrounds the heart (the pericardium).
Thallium-201 stress test,"An x-ray study that follows the path of radioactive potassium carried by the blood into heart muscle. Damaged or dead muscle can be defined, as can the extent of narrowing in an artery."
Third-degree heart block,"A serious condition also called Stokes-Adams disease; impulses from the heart’s upper chambers (the atria) are completely blocked from reaching the heart’s lower chambers (the ventricles). To make up for this, the ventricles use their own “backup” pacemaker with its slower rate."
Thrombolysis,The breaking up of a blood clot.
Thrombosis,A blood clot that forms inside the blood vessel or cavity of the heart.
Thrombolytic therapy,Intravenous or intra-arterial medicines that are used to dissolve blood clots in an artery.
Thrombus,A blood clot.
Thyroid,"A gland located in the front of the neck, just below the voice box."
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),A clot-dissolving medicine that is used to treat heart attack and stroke patients.
Trans fat,"Created when hydrogen is forced through an ordinary vegetable oil (hydrogenation), converting some polyunsaturates to monounsaturates, and some monounsaturates to saturates. Trans fat, like saturated fat, tends to raise LDL cholesterol levels, and, unlike saturated fat, trans fat also lowers HDL cholesterol levels."
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI),"A minimally invasive procedure to repair a damaged or diseased aortic valve. A catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and threaded to the heart. A balloon at the end of the catheter, with a replacement valve folded around it, delivers the new valve to take the place of the old. Also called TAVR (Transcatheter aortic valve replacement)."
Transcatheter intervention,Any of the noninvasive procedures usually performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Angioplasty is an example of a transcatheter intervention. Also called a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Transesophageal echocardiography,"A diagnostic test that analyzes sound waves bounced off the heart. The sound waves are sent through a tube-like device inserted in the mouth and passed down the esophagus (food pipe), which ends near the heart. This technique is useful in studying patients whose heart and vessels, for various reasons, are difficult to assess with standard echocardiography."
Transient ischemic attack (TIA),A stroke-like event that lasts only for a short time and is caused by a temporarily blocked blood vessel.
Transplantation,Replacing a failing organ with a healthy one from a donor.
Tricuspid valve,The structure that controls blood flow from the heart’s upper right chamber (the right atrium) into the lower right chamber (the right ventricle).
Triglyceride,"The most common fatty substance found in the blood; normally stored as an energy source in fat tissue. High triglyceride levels may thicken the blood and make a person more susceptible to clot formation. High triglyceride levels tend to accompany high cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease, such as obesity."
Ultrasound,"High-frequency sound vibrations, which cannot be heard by the human ear, used in medical diagnosis."
Valve replacement,An operation to replace a heart valve that is either blocking normal blood flow or causing blood to leak backward into the heart (regurgitation).
Valvuloplasty,Reshaping of a heart valve with surgical or catheter techniques.
Varicose vein,Any vein that is abnormally dilated (widened).
Vascular,Pertains to the blood vessels.
Vasodilators,Any medicine that dilates (widens) the arteries.
Vasopressors,Any medicine that elevates blood pressure.
Vein,"Any one of a series of blood vessels of the vascular system that carries blood from various parts of the body back to the heart, returning oxygen-poor blood to the heart."
Ventricle (right and left),One of the two lower chambers of the heart.
Ventricular Assist Device (VAD),"A mechanical pump that helps the ventricles pump blood, easing the workload of the heart in patients with heart failure."
Ventricular fibrillation,"A condition in which the ventricles contract in a rapid, unsynchronized fashion. When fibrillation occurs, the ventricles cannot pump blood throughout the body."
Ventricular tachycardia,An arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) in the ventricle characterized by a very fast heartbeat.
Vertigo,A feeling of dizziness or spinning.
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,A condition in which an extra electrical pathway connects the atria (two upper chambers) and the ventricles (two lower chambers). It may cause a rapid heartbeat.
X-ray,Form of radiation used to create a picture of internal body structures on film.
