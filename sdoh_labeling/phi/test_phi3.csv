26,Almonte General Hospital,Emergency,"After a telephone appointment with my family physician early XXXXXX morning (XXXXXXXXXXXXXX), I was advised by her to proceed to the emergency department promptly for testing and further exploration of my symptoms. The symptoms that I was experiencing were in regards to a possible miscarriage that I was experiencing.  Unfortunately, due to persistent health issues, I have spent a significant amount of time in a hospital in XXXXXX.  Although my experiences have always been adequate, the physicians often lacked empathy, kindness and comforting bedside manner.  My husband and I recently moved to XXXXXXX (approx 6 months ago).  And, with this being my first pregnancy and with the current pandemic (my husband unable to accompany me), I was extremely anxious and emotional, especially to go to a hospital that was unfamiliar to me.  After seeing a triage nurse and being registered, I was escorted to a room in the emergency department.  A few moments later, Dr. XXXXXX entered the room and greeted me with a warm and comforting tone, spoke slowly and calmly towards me and was very patient as I anxiously asked questions.   Dr. XXXXXX explained that she would order blood work, perform a pelvic examination, and schedule an ultrasound.  When it came time for the pelvic examination, I explained that this would be extremely difficult due to a history of trauma.  I asked questions and Dr. XXXXXX patiently explained the reasons why she recommended the examination, but ultimately let me decide what I was comfortable with.  I felt zero pressure whatsoever and decided to proceed with her recommendation. Dr. XXXXXX offered to have a nurse hold my hand to provide comfort, which I gratefully accepted.  When it came time to begin, Dr. XXXXXX paused and said If you want me to stop at any moment, let me know.  Remember, you are in control.  I don't think Dr. XXXXXX understands how much those four simple words ""You are in control"" truly made me feel.  Sadly, after all of the testing was completed, Dr. XXXXXX confirmed our suspicions that I did indeed suffer a miscarriage.  It is so difficult to process a loss like this, but we are strong and I know as time passes, we will heal.  However, if there is one thing that I will not forget about that day, was Dr. XXXXXX's ability to make me feel so safe.  Dr. XXXXXX, thank you so much for your excellent care.  My husband and I appreciate your kindness more than you will never know.",2020-07-01 00:00:00,,,,2020,2438,,Simple Solutions for Improving Health Care,Noteworthy Positive Experiences,,,,,,,Naama,2023-02-10 00:00:00,,,no_sdoh

227,Almonte General Hospital,Emergency,"From attachment - I would like to thank the doctor cared for XXXXX.  Even thought the waiting room was full, she did not rush with him.  After he had set his hand she went to walk out of the room, stopped, came back and sat on the bed with him an shared a story about her own son's struggle at school and pointed out that he should never punch a locker again.  That he needed to learn to walk away.  As a parent, I really appreciated that.  Sometimes what mom and dad say means nothing but to hear it from another adult in a position of respect might actually get through to him.  My only complaint and I hate to say anything since the doctor was SO AMAZING and KIND was that she did not wait long enough for the beta blocker to kick in before setting his hand.  She only waited a minute.  It took me and two nurses to hold him down as the bones were being set and I don't think that couldn't helped much to the quality of the set (it almost needed surgery).  He was writhing in pain and crying.  It was one of the worst experiences of my motherhood  The plastic surgeon at CHEO said that this is one of the most common errors in emergency medicine - not waiting long enough for the pain blockers to kick in.  Five minutes after the setting my son was remarking that he couldn't feel a thing and how he wished they had waited a bit longer.  We would not have minded if the doctor had left the room to speak to another patient and then come back to set it but I guess we couldn't lost the window all together if she could not get away from the net patient easily.  All this to say, it was a positive experience and we were so grateful for the care of the nurse and our wonderful doctor.",2019-09-01 00:00:00,,,,2019,1685,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

They wrote everything on a red bracelet and put on my wrist.  When I returned to eating, the first breakfast I received was an egg, a carton of milk, corn cereal, and toast.  I can't have eggs, milk or corn.  I told them I could not eat this breakfast.  They took it and said they would bring me a new one.  It was exactly the same....  This was my whole stay.  I had to beg for just a salad.  They got mad at me and said that it wasn't written down.  Over the course of my first day there, 6 people must have asked me about my food issues.  I was very weak, sick and trying to recover, and starving.  My family was 2 hours away so no one could bring me some food.  I found a bit of change in my pocket and bought some peanuts in the vending machine.  I was very upset with this.  I had to finally pick at some things. They were making me sicker by giving me the food I could not eat. I stayed for 5 days. I believe I was there longer because of the stress and issues caused by the food I had to eat and the fact that I barely ate anything.  People that do not have food issues can roll their eyes at this rant, but it is not fun.  I once could eat whatever I wanted and I never asked for diet changes.  It is a real problem everywhere.

She is non verbal and requires her support staff to advocate on her behalf as well as describe her symptoms and signs that have been observed. More often than not we are met with difficulties and disbelief when describing signs and symptoms. Often our clients medical concerns are overlooked because of the fact they have a disability instead of looking past the fact they have a preexisting condition. It is felt that doctors and nurses don't seem to have the medical training necessary to support people with disabilities, or the patience and understanding to listen to and believe the support staff.  This is a problem that has been ongoing for many years.

I had called my doctor for a prescription refill for something I did not expect to need, but my asthma-like cough (which I only get occasionally) had returned, and I was leaving on a trip at 6:00 the next morning. My doctor was off, so I was advised by staff at the Health Clinic to go to emergency. While being triaged I explained this clearly (as clearly as I could through coughing) to the nurse. I was sent back to the waiting room and after 4 1/2 hours, I left. I realize that the emergency department isn't there to just refill prescriptions, but I had explained the unusual (for me) circumstances. All I needed was 5 minutes with a doctor. I also understand how triage works, but at least 4 people who came in after me (all of them coughing) were called in before me. I felt that I was put at the end of the list because I 'should have thought to get a refill sooner.' Fair enough...except the cough had only started on XXXXXXXX; I thought I'd be able to get in touch with my doctor on XXXXXX. All of which I explained.

We were the only people admitted on the unit when we had our son.  Our first child no idea what to expect.  Being the only patient on the floor you would think we would be taken good care of however we barely saw any nurses the first day and a half.  We had to ask for our newborn to be bathed when he was X days old.  The drs cleared us to leave, we wanted to go then the nurses told us we couldn't because there were all these tests and blood work that had to be done on our son before we could go.  No one told us about these tests.  We asked for them to be done so we could go home and then they were unable to do them because the ward then started to fill up and they got busy.  We asked why none of these tests had been done while we were the only people on the floor and the nurses had time.  Especially when we saw them sitting having tea and playing on their phones.  The nurses then got rude with us and scolded us for having to many visitors.  We only had a few and if the nurses had come in and said we have tests to run it would not have been a problem.  They were extremely rude to my husband on several occasions when he asked them a question or to assist with something even though they had nothing going on.  We had to stay in hospital an extra night after drs cleared us due to waiting on tests, etc.  Because we were told at that point we were not a priority because others had come in and we were in labour and birthing.  Apparently we were never a priority to them.  When the nurse removed my dressing from my C section she was in a bad mood and very aggressive and ripped it off so much so it took skin off with it.  I am left with a scar 2 months postpartum.  When we have our second child we will not be coming to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX we will be going to XXXXXXXXXXXX.

907,Almonte General Hospital,Inpatient,"When I arrived at the hospital I was admitted right away as my contractions were pretty close together. I was checked right away and found to be 6cm dilated. I requested an epidural almost right away. When I was to receive the epidural I immediately felt the urge to push (20 minutes after the doctor first checked me). I felt the Dr should have checked me before I was prepped for the epidural as the nurse could see I was having strong contractions. The fact that this was overlooked made me feel as myself and the baby could have been in danger as I was very far along once the anesthesiologist arrived.   Also, the nurse that was attending me seemed new and inexperienced. Every time I would answer her questions she would have to leave the room to check with her superiors. Her attitude towards all my questions and my level of pain was very dismissive as well This did not make me feel very comfortable in her care. Once my water broke she became very flustered which again made me panic. Luckily, a more experience nurse came to my side and was able to help me through the delivery. I can't remember her name but I was very happy with how she handled the situation.  When we were ready to leave the hospital it took 5-6 hours to be discharged. Again, the same inexperienced nurse was there and she seem to keep forgetting about us. We waited for hours for things she said would be completed in minutes.   Overall my experience at the hospital was tarnished by this nurse and her inexperience, lack of organization and dismissive attitude.

I liked that i got my own room and that my family could come at any time to visit me. The only thing that my husband and I did not like was that every night of our (3 night stay) we were woken up along with our baby to have tests done. For example myself along with my newborn were woken up at 3 am to complete a hearing test. He was asleep and it took me a while to get him back to sleep. The following night he was woken again at 1 am for blood work then again at 5ish to feed him ( I didn't like that I had to wake my baby up to feed him, I always thought to never wake a sleeping baby and he will let me know when he is hungry). I was aware that they were really busy as may was a busy month ( I delivered XXXXXXXXXX).  Lastly I did complain that my stomach hurt me a lot, but was told that it was not all after a C section.

1005,Bluewater,Service Alert,"1) Morphine scrambled my mother's brain -- she could not balance herself, which made her terrified to sit up, get out of bed, stand up. Doctor and nurses were ready to write her off as a goner. But it was just the morphine -- when she got switched to tramadol, she was back to her regular self the same day. Plus the morphine did not work on her pain, and the morphine and tylenol combo just knocked her out. People should know that morphine has side-effects. 2) In the beginning week after the operation when my mother was so unbalanced and terrified, I noticed that the physio people were all small and therefore weak and therefore scared to hurt themselves (legimately since my mother was 187 pounds). We brought in a couple of her grandchildren who are muscular guys 6-4 and 6-5, and they lifted her to her feet and shuffled her around the room -- and then my mother realized she could do this, and her progress was rapid after that. (She was off the morphine by then). 3) Now that I am helping my mother at home, I realize why one nurse would always call for a second nurse to help move her on her bed, or to her feet in the beginning. My ligaments get sore. And I am a guy and bigger and stronger than the nurses. So keep up that procedure. 4) Nurses did not always come immediately for bedpans and bathroom assistance. At age XX, my mother cannot hold it for more than a minute. It would actually cause the nurses much more work to clean up. I got the idea that if the designated nurse was busy, that the other nurses in the pool were reluctant to back her up immediately? 5) It seemed like it was never the same nurse from day to day. I found that I was telling the nurses what was happening. Sometimes they knew, sometimes they didn't seem to. 6) Being with my mother everyday, I noticed that the woman in the next bed was not doing well in the morning -- unable to find words and make sentences, unable to remember, scared. I'm not sure the nurses noticed the pattern, because when I told her doctor, he seemed struck by the knowledge, and I think he adjusted her medication because she got much better after that. 7) Why does pureed meat taste so bad? My mother would barely eat a few bites. Can you do more hamburger which is already ground and doesn't taste bad? 8) My mother was glad to do the afternoon activities on the Rehab ward. Thanks. 9) The nurses all had beautiful posture. I imagine it helps keep them safe and painless.

1009,Bluewater,General,"1. My experience in Labour and Delivery was very positive. The nurses and doctors were great. I had to stay a second night because my baby had jaundice. Initially we were told the baby would go to the nursery and be under the blue light in a incubator. The nursery ended up being full so we were moved to paediatrics and the incubator was in my room. The Ped's nurse on days was great, she explained everything and was very kind (which meant a lot considering I was a new mom). The night shift was a different experience. There seemed to be a lack of communication between the nurses. At one point we were told to just shut the alarm off on the machine that was monitoring the baby's vitals. I told the nurse I was not comfortable with that. If the alarm went off - I thought they should check on her. We were also told to leave the door open because the temperature at one point was too high. The day shift nurse had said to NEVER walk away with the door open. During our baby's time in the incubator they would rotate her. When the nurse wanted to put our baby on her stomach during the night, I explained that I was not comfortable with that as I had asked if they can hear the alarm at the desk and she said no. I knew I was exhausted and wasn't sure I would wake up. At the bottom of the machine it said that the machine was out of paper and that it wasn't recording. I am not a health care professional by an means, but it does not sit well with me that if something was to go wrong - there was no record of it. I have thought about the treatment we received on our second night in the hospital and it was unacceptable. Initially I thought maybe I was being hormonal after having a baby, but looking back now I still think it was unacceptable. I have also thought maybe they were short staffed that night, etc - whatever the reason maybe, it would have went along way to explain that. They could of all been having a bad shift, I don't know but after our second night there, we couldn't get out of there fast enough. So, I wouldn't recommend XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for labour and delivery. If my baby for some reason had to be admitted - I would choose another hospital and if we had to be in XXXXXX and we by chance had the same ped's nurses, I would request a different nurse.",2018-08-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Obstetrics,"Access/Coord of Care, Doctor/Physician, Information/Education, Nurse/Nurse aide, Respect to Patient",2018,2278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

1015,Bluewater,Service Alert,"1. Your survey questions refers to my ""first visit"" to the emergency dept. & have been answered accordingly. 2. However I had a further XXXX visits which did not always go so good. Dates of these visits are as follows: XXXXXXX - XXXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX XXXX - XXXXXX XXXX - XXXXXXX - XXXXXXX - XXXXXXX. 3. Reasons for visits: underwent surgery on XXXXXXX had overnight stay in hospital. Overnight XXXXXXX suffered severe pain & nausea in stomach. Informed night shift nurse & was given Gravol, did no good. Could not urinate or have bowel movement. Was discharged from hospital AM on XXXXXXX still with severe pain. Nausea had gone after I had vomited. Around midnight of the XXXXXXX I had first visit to emergency. 4. EMR checked bladder found to be full! X-rays of the bowel were also found to be full! Bladder was drained and was given a catheter. Attended to quickly & pain subsided! Each subsequent visit was due to extreme pain in stomach caused by bladder filling to capacity. 5. Without exception every EMR doctor told me I should never have been discharged from hospital in my condition it was a disgrace! 6. Each & every visit to EMR was for the same reason ""bladder full"" on first visit oni XXXXXXX triage informed me that had I waited another hour I could have in serious trouble due to the high level of urine getting near the kidneys. 7. Major concern was time spent sitting in waiting room in ""extreme pain"", with full bladder. Sometimes for hours, plus waiting to see a doctor. Would have thought a full bladder would warrant some urgency to get bladder emptied. Especially in EMR. 8. Other problems during subsequent visits which contributed to bladder being full were catheter too big, too small, insufficient pressure to hold catheter in place, catheter plugged due to blood clots. Urethra plugged required flushing. 9. Approximately around my ""XXXXXXXXX"" I requested to speak to a urologist but the EMR doctor informed me I wasn't bad enough for that & so the urologist would not come! 10. Eventually, seen by Dr. XXXXX (urologist) who was fuming that he was not called as he was on duty at the time and would have come right away! At this time I was diagnosed with an ""extremely large prostate"" which was causing my problem. Diagnoses was given on XXXXXXX!

1212,Bluewater,Service Alert,"Because I have had many surgeries and health problems, I was prescribed narcotics for pain. Unfortunately, I became addicted to opiates, therefore I am now on methadone to fight this addiction. I was never the typical drug addict ont he street, because I do have chronic pain and my pain medicine was prescribed by my doctor. I feel that in XXXXXX, we have a terrible problem with drug addiction to opiates. When I visit the emergency department and tell the nurse in triage and registration about my addiction to opiates, I feel that the nurse and sometimes doctors treat me differently. I have chronic health problems with severe pain and I am treated with less respect because of my addiction. Although I don't ask for pain meds, I have been told not to expect that I will be given pain meds during my visit or to take home. I feel that I am disrespected because another patient who doesn't have a drug addiction would never be warned that they will not receive pain meds. Believe me, I never thought I would be a drug addict because I never took drugs in my life, I don't fit the typical drug addict profile but I am treated as one. I feel bad enough about my addiction, but when I am treated this way at the hospital it makes me feel worse. I would recommend that your nurse and doctors be educated on drug addiction. Not all drug addicts chose to take drugs and abuse them, there are a lot of people in my situation that needed the pain meds and became addicted. We should not be treated as if we're going to the hospital just ot get drugs. I had a total hip replacement 3 years ago and I got an infection so I had to have the surgery redone because the infection was so severe, the surgeon left the incision open so it could heal from the inside out and drain. The wound was 12 inches long and 6 inches deep into my leg, it took 8 months for the wound to close completely. The pain was severe but my surgeon Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX sent me home with nothing for pain because I am a drug addict. I was told by other physicians that I should have reported him to the medical board, I was very fortunate because my family doctor was very caring and understood that I was not asking for pain meds to get high. I absolutely needed pain meds because the pain was so severe, but Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX didn't care. He was just concerned about prescribing to a junkie, that's how I feel when I am treated this way. It's a shame that medical professionals don't know anything about drug addiction, and that we're not all the junky on the street that they assume we are. If you would like to discuss this further, you may contact me at XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and ask for XXXXX, thank you",2019-08-01 00:00:00,Negative,Emergency Sarnia,"Admit/Registration, Doctor/Physician, Emergency Dept, Nurse/Nurse aide, Physical Comfort, Respect to Patient",2019,2667,,Discrimination: Drug Use,Disrespect and Rudeness,Inadequate Pain Management,,,,,,Sakeina,Before December 2 2022,,,no_sdoh

1701,Bluewater,Service Alert,"From attachment - NRC Health XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Patient Experience of care Survey XXXXXXXXXXX Survey - * U1ERSI1X * 1816354098 27906 XXXXXXXXXXXXX To Whom it may concern, Although the survey has been completed for my XXXXXXXXX visit to the ER, I feel compelled to disclose my previous experience in this department. I appreciate you taking the time to read my letter and validating my voice. In XXXXXXXX, I arrived at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and received standard procedures for people who are admitted for mental health issues. The concern I have is some of the procedures were traumatizing for me. For the past 3 1/2 years, I have been learning about some of my childhood experiences in conjunction with therapy from a trauma specialist. As such, I'd like to take this opportunity to outline some experiences I had during this XXXXXX visit as well as one from XXXXXXXXX. To be frank, some of the procedures I received at both visits re-traumatized me. Many CSA (childhood sexual abuse) survivors live in constant fear of the unknown as they were never sure, as children, when, where, and/or who was going to abuse them. I believe information about being a sexual assault victim was recorded in XXXXXXX as it was discussed between my staff caregivers and myself. I am not aware if this information was available to staff at the time of my ER visit and admittance in XXXXXXX. Regardless, being re-traumatized by your standard procedures was devesting to me and my trauma and recovery work that is helping me heal from my abusive childhood. Experience like: being in the ""holding"" room while 2 strange (security) men block the entrance; being led to a room in an unknown location by 2 strange men; being aggressively strapped to a table while 2 strange men: being in this room after being drugged while being watched by 2 strange men; and listening to staff tell my husband that I ""just"" wasn't myself. These experiences heightened my fear off the charts as the memory of them have already been stored in my CNS. To reiterate, this was an extremely re-traumatizing experience on both dates mentioned earlier while in the ER department. Again, I appreciate you hearing my voice with regard to this matter. As a CSA survivor, without voices and the willingness to hear them, change will not happen. Neither will understanding of trauma and it's impact nor respect for those who have experienced it. I would be open to further discussion regarding my concerns if you feel it is required. There are countless trauma survivors in our community, as well as others, and the hope is they will not be re-traumatized by the ER department and other areas of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

1702,Bluewater,Contact Requested,"From attachment - The hospital staff were all informative, polite, professional employees. My biggest objection with my hospital stay was the hospital meals. On a scale from one to ten - one being the worst and ten being the best, I found the hospital nutrition meals were a one at best. I did bring this up with the staff about the meals, I was told they were following the Canadian food guide. If that is the case then the Canadian food guide needs to change their menus. The hospital is catering meals from outside of XXXXXX. The hospital should go back to cooking nutritional meals for all the patients and staff. The hospital gives the best treatment for the patients except when it comes to eating. It is terrible unfortunate that the hospital is serving unhealthy meals. Good nutritional meals should go hand in hand with helping patients recover from their illnesses. Food places an important place in patient recovery.

1827,Bluewater,General,"Hello, I have used XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ER department many times since my youngest child has been born with a medical condition that require treatment - I have both a family doctor (in town) and three specialist in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. I try my best not to visit this ER, unless I need to as I do understand that some other condition are more of an emergency then my sons - however sometimes I need to use the ER. I have had horrible treatment at this ER, where some of my doctors in XXXXXX have shaken their head at! Ie - not giving xray for treatment of pneumonia because there is an ear infection plus chest and have said 'oh well the antibiotics he is on will kill it is he actually has pneumonia' which I completely understand - however when trying to rule out diagnoses and needed chest xray to compare - I didn't' 'have it, as XXXXXX didn't xray - I am not a doctor and I have great respect for doctors as they have been through many years of education to be a doctor - I also know they are human also and can make mistakes! What I find is even when I told them I/XXXXXX would like an xray to compare, I would like the xray to make sure they seem not to listen to the 'mother' again I understand I am not the doctor and I don't have the education to make that decision - but they need to listen to the 'parent ' who is caring also for that sick child. There has been two times where a 'radiologist has indicated pneumonia and my XXXXXX doctor as gotten to look and said for adults yes, for children NO way and that doctor had indicated she felt a doctor that read that particular xray did not know how to read children xrays! Which to me is very scary - if you don't know how to read them, I don't think you should be reading children xrays. Triage - can be frustrating! one of the worst trips I had was when we had been in XXXXXX for surgery - we had stayed over night and was in 'isolation' as my children lungs were washed and needed to be in isolation. WE were released from XXXXXX with instructions what to do it we 'saw' some symptoms! Which we did start to see - I went to my family doctor got to care I needed, with instructions on what to do! Unfortunately I ended up at your ER for treatment as it was not getting any better and I couldn't go the night! We were triage, I told the nurse everything we had just been through. I stressed being in isolation and she put me back in waiting room (full of people) and I waited holding my baby 40 plus fever for 4 hours!!! Then I get back to 'low' and a nurse apologized and said you can't be in low you need to be in high! Which I knew we needed to be! We finally get to high and the doctor (which I have had many times) was good! did listen to me, and we discussed my options. However it set my little guy back being in that waiting room, not being placed in the right division in the hospital. I have very high regards for my city, I have very high regards for XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and I have used it many many many times, not just the ER but with having many health problems I try my best not to visit this ER site. I have filled out a couple of these surveys, thinking every and all info is important for people to learn and make better - but I am disappointed, when I return and nothing seems to have changed. I am only taking the time to write this so you are aware and can make this a better experience for everyone involved. I can be reached at XXXXXXXXXXXX If you have anymore questions, as I have taken my little guy many times and have more experience (mostly not good) that I just don't' have the time to report on here.

1877,Bluewater,Service Alert,"I am a professional in the community and very healthy person who had an unfortunate situation at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX following an emergency gull bladder surgery. Upon the initial surgery, I was not recovering as the medical team expected and instead of believing me and the pain I was in, kept questioning me. I had to defend myself multiple times and with each person (nurse, doctor ect.) that came into the room every few hours. Every new medical personnel that came into my room didn't always seem to know what was going on or would adamantly tell me it was only gas that I was experiencing. They weren't always certain of what treatment/amount of medication etc. I was supposed to be on, or if changes had been made to these (i.e. higher dose), they were not always aware and the process of me explaining had to start all over again. This constant need to defend myself was also true of the surgeon who actually with an angered tone, directed his frustration over the lack of my recovery speed. He did this in front of my husband also who was aghast! As if I would not want to recover easily and quickly and get home to my family. The surgeon showed this frustration by questioning why I was not recovering at the expected rate since I had just had a 'simple routine' procedure done. Unfortunately, I had to go through many days of excruciating pain, trouble breathing and begging for support and further investigation for the medical team and doctors to figure out that I was not wrong and finally ordered some special testing to be done. By that point, I was suffering an infection and the physical results of poisonous bile collecting throughout my entire abdomen which had also pooled in the cavity under my lung, I was told that during my initial surgery my liver got 'nicked' by accident and I that I would require a second surgery. I had an extremely bad experience but still, I have given the hospital a 4/10 because there were many individuals that did help me. There were a few nurses that truly did try to help and my family doctor who's known me my whole life bumped into me and then tried to help me out as well. Actually, it was only after my family doctor saw me that I started to see the further investigation into my condition. I do understand and appreciate that my life was in the hands of the entire medical team and since I survived it all, am so very thankful and grateful. What I didn't appreciate, is that I was treated like an untrustworthy and unreliable teenager who they assumed to be dishonest, exaggerating or possibly getting addicted to pain medications. That is the constant impression that I (and my family that was there) was getting from the tone and demeanour of many of the staff. The medical team did not take into account 'me' as a person and that as a XX old woman (mother of 3) who understands her pain threshold, possibly knew something was wrong about my own situation. I am a very patient and kind person, who didn't deserve to be treated this way. After it was noted that there was a mistake made during the first surgery, I did see a change in how I was being treated but it shouldn't have taken this, for that to be the case. I had no intention of staying in the hospital more than the day max they initially said to me when all of this started, but due to all the complications ended up being a 12 day stay. It then took me multiple months to fully recover as I had to have a drain put in which stayed in for multiple weeks also.

You don't even know that your loved one is gone because they have your voice recorded they have taken video of you. They can delete crime from surveillance cameras. Everything will disappear off there phones unless the sim cards removed, but with the new game I don't think you need a sim. Over half of Canadians can't pay their bills because of the bikers and the Asian games. They want me dead because I am the only person who has figured them out. They communicate through music stations also the the D. They take over small businesses. The internet should be shut down across Canada until a solution to this has happened. My brothers are all dead. My kids are possibly dead. Working for the weekend song they like to play. They have caused me to loose every friend I have. I am out on bail and can't go to my home in XXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXX drives me crazy because I am loosing my mind, and nobody believes me. They have taken my husband, my home, my brothers lives, any friendship I have had with anyone due to they are into the phone wires and now they are tethered into the hydro wires. I believe a lot of wires are in Lake Huron as I have seen them go out but not return. I don't know how or where I am going to be safe due to the amount of people playing this game, and they are all walks of life. Even the jail and courthouse has this since they have cell phones in there. They have taken everything I have ever worked for. I have nothing left.

In the Asian games through sms they use slang, example when they have to go out and get a young girl they will call it work, instead of saying wife they say life. I know my husband doesn't want to do this but he is being forced. The hells angels have a great part to play in this as I say my neighbor XXXXXXXX home have bikers and a young girl go to it, but I have not seen XXXXX nor her boyfriend who is a jail nurse.

The communication with the dietician for my celiac disease did not happen. The staff was unknowledgeable as to what is in their own food. They brought me food I cannot have for celiac disease, nor for a tonsil procedure. They gave me soup saying it was alright but I vomited multiple times after I got home. I waited 8 hours to go to the washroom, two hours for water to drink, and 2.5 hours for pain medication. Two nurses reprimanded me for calling them the wrong names when I am blind and didn't know it was different people as they did not say who they were. The dietician didn't know a cream soup she suggested had gluten in it and I shouldn't have to educate the dietician. The nursing staff were gossiping in the hall and treated my celiac disease as a joke saying. It was a hostile comment that I cannot recall the exact wording of. My mother had to tell them that it was diagnosed by a hospital surgeon after a hospital procedure done at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and that I am not gluten -free to be trendy. The nursing staff had a bad attitude toward my vision impairment of being legally blind as well as toward my having Asperger's and anxiety. I went in under confidential because I experienced domestic violence earlier in the year from my biological father and the police were involved. I don't think the nursing staff was very respectful about my request for confidential status and thought it was because of an ex - boyfriend or something. They don't know that my mother is being stalked by him, that he is a jealous drunk with a lot of weapons, etc. It is the small percentage of true domestic violence with a high risk of lethality. My mother tried to impress this upon them before I was admitted but they didn't even want to know who I didn't want in my room, what his name or connection to me was, or what to do in case he did show up (you would need about 4 officers to control him). I did not get to see a dietician prior to admission, and had to request and advocate to get the dietician in but it was a couple hours after lunch had passed and I couldn't eat what was on my tray. I heard a nurse tell another lady in the room who had a knee replacement who had said that she rang the button to go to the washroom over two hours prior, and the nurse told that lady to 'pee the bed.'

2335,Bluewater,Service Alert,"I visited the ER two times for this last visit - once around 10 pm, where there was an excellent, caring male nurse in triage who understood my symptoms (extrapyramidal syndrome from medication) & suggested I return the next morning as just bloodwork was required. I took his advice, and returned the next morning, but had a terrible experience with the next, female, triage nurse on duty. She was very dismissive of my symptoms, did not recognize what extrapyramidal syndrome was, and questioned why I was even at the ER. I ended up leaving, as it wasn't worth being treated in such as disrespectful way, and received care at a walk-in clinic (as my family doctor was closed for the weekend). I speculate that once she saw that I was taking antipsychotic mediation (for OCD - the meds that were causing the syndrome), she became very patronizing to me. I didn't end up sharing with her that I have a medical science background and have a very good understanding of my condition and was at the ER upon the urging of my pharmacist. Unfortunately, I am a bit leery of returning. I've only been on this serious medication for the past few years postpartum, and I definitely feel that the few times I've been to the hospital since, the tone that some of the nurses & doctors take with me is different that when I was not taking the meds. Last year, I visited in XXXXXXXXX with a very serious allergic reaction to another, related medication, and was told that I was being over-anxious.

2372,Bluewater,General,"I was disgusted how the ER doctor treated not only myself, but my daughter and others in the ER dept. His first name was XXXXX sp? He was very rude and told me 'sorry I had such a shitty day'. I was in an MVA arrived by ambulance then was wheeled out to the ER waiting room for 7 hours. This doctor was rude to my young daughter and had her in tears. I was in a lot of pain and he said well I can give your 'Percocet but if that doesn't work then there is always fentanyl sp?' I thought this was ridiculous especially when there is such a 'drug problem'. I heard the way he spoke to others in the ER very ignorant to others for eg. told a man across from where I was that his back issue was that he was 'too fat', there was Asian woman who couldn't speak or understand much English and he basically told her to take 'percocets' and she was upset because she was afraid it would make her sick. Language barrier and the woman left. He pretty much yelled when he spoke to people. It was like everyone was a 'pain in the ass'. He had a real attitude. This doctor should go back to school and learn some bedside manners & stop pushing these addictive drugs. Also you could feel the tension amongst the nurses as they were quite snippy with each other.

2469,Bluewater,Service Alert,"I was seeking assistance from the advice of my family doctor, who stated if symptoms worsened over weekend to go immediately to ED. I saw my doctor XXXXXX. Symptoms were severe XXXXXXXX and I went into ED both XXXXXXXX and XXXXXX. The doctor I saw XXXXXXXX (Dr XXXXXXXXX) treated me poorly and rolled his eyes when I had told him my doctors instructions from previous day. Dr XXXXXXXXX also prescribed me Naproxen, which was definitely contraindicated to the medication I was taking (Fragmin blood thinner injections post partum as per my hematologist). He also did not seem concerned with the fact that I had a less than X week old newborn at home who I was breastfeeding, and I was very concerned with medications. Dr XXXXXXXXX first attempted to give an intramuscular antibiotic injection which after asking several times about the safety of this injection while breastfeeding, I finally received an IV antibiotic. Dr XXXXXXXXX still prescribed the naproxen even after I reminded him and the nurse about taking Fragmin injections. Luckily I am a health professional myself and did not fill the prescription and confirmed the following day that I should not be taking that medication. XXXXXX I returned to ED where I was treated by Dr XXXXXX and his resident Dr XXXX, where I received excellent care. I ended up going to XXXXXX for a CT then ended up getting sent to XXXXXX that evening to be seen by a specialist. The care I received from Dr XXXXXX and Dr XXXX was excellent. After being sent to XXXXXX and having multiple followup appointments in XXXXXX as well, I felt Dr XXXXXXXXX did not take my concerns and condition seriously enough. I consider myself lucky to have the background I have otherwise I could have ended up in worse condition then what I arrived with (with a XXX week old baby at home). The results of the survey were based solely on my experience on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, not XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. My care on XXXXXXXX I would rate extremely poorly.

However, he went on to explain that he would not prescribe this to me as he 'didn't know my history'. This was insulting and showed medical bias. His solution? - to provide me with an antibiotic and puffer - both of which I had just completed (prescribed by US doctor). In addition, this visit was to the ED on XXXXXXXXXXXXX after having spent 10 days in the US. Upon my arrival at the ED, I had to INSIST on a mask as I had potentially been exposed to COVID-19, information I shared with the triage nurse and the intern who initially examined me. The protocols were sadly lacking at Bluewater Health and clearly they were unprepared for anyone with a respiratory illness. It is a sad state when the patient knows how to manage an illness better than the health care professionals. As a result of the lack of help from Dr. XXXXXX, I was required to see my family doctor on an emergency basis the following day to get the required treatment.

Every meal was cold - because it was cold it tasted horrible e.g. meatballs & pasta w/ sauce. Medication - blood thinners are not to be given if the patient is on a baby aspirin from the small pick for diabetes blood was running down my finger. It seems that not all are kept up to speed which causes confusion. Blood to thin could cause a huge problem.

2963,Bluewater,General,"My baby was premature (born at XXXX weeks). We knew in advance he was coming early so I was given steroids in the days before to help with his lung development. After I delivered, my baby was placed on my lower stomach near my pubic bone for less than a minute while the doctor cut the umbilical cord. My newborn son was then whisked away to be looked at and measured and all that. He was, however, screaming, which meant he was breathing. I wanted to do skin to skin care immediately after birth, as well as attempting breastfeeding. Of all the things I planned in my birth plan, that was the MOST IMPORTANT to me. To have immediate skin to skin for as long as I needed in order to bond and establish my milk supply. I was, however, not given the chance to ask for what I wanted. In the days following, my son was on IV AND fed formula from a bottle, even though I wanted to exclusively breastfeed. I pumped my breastmilk, but was not allowed to breastfeed my son for several days, and when I was allowed, it was only allowed once per day so my baby wouldn't tire out. However, he continued to bottle feed and pacified with a soother. I'm not sure how those things didn't tire him out, but breastfeeding does? This continued for the 12 days my son was in the nursery. Anyway, we're now 6 weeks after birth, and I'm still struggling with my milk supply and am forced to supplement with formula. It's not really the route I wanted to go as bottle cleaning and preparation is very time consuming, and formula is expensive and not as convenient, which has been tough on me as a single mom. My entire experience with XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was overall a good experience, but I was disappointed with the moments following my sons birth, and my inability to be allowed to breastfeed him.",2019-05-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Obstetrics,"Access/Coord of Care, Emotional Support",2019,1775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

3015,Bluewater,Service Alert,"My hospital stay was good, however the first time I was at Emergency from a fall on ice, in which I was brought in via ambulance, my hip and shoulder were xrayed and showed a fracture on my shoulder. They told me no hip fracture, I was given a stabilizer sling. When I went to get up off the bed I told the nurse it was extremely painful and I could barely weight bear on that leg. The nurse helped me into a wheel chair and wheeled me out to the waiting room so I could call a cab. A really nice patient in the waiting room helped me into a cab, the cab driver brought me to the drug store to have a script filled and then took me home. Two days later I had to call 911 and have them take me back to the hospital because I could not get up on my own. A second set of X-ray showed that I had a fractured pelvis. I was then admitted, they were aware that I had just moved to XXXXXX and had no family or friends here to assist me with home care. The next day physio came in and wanted me to walk, I had told them I had not had pain medication yet and mostly my hip and leg was very painful, they still wanted me to walk, so I did. Later that day my ankle had become red painful and swollen, I had sprained my ankle from walking earlier, I was then put on no weight bearing. I was brought down fracture clinic, and a soft cast was applied at that time they had noticed that the wrong sling was given and they put the correct one on. I guess to sum this up I feel that during my first visit I should not have been released, I could barely walk and had no one at home to assist me. Physio should have not have been so adamant that I walk.

3105,Bluewater,General,"My symptoms were sore throat/pain, intermittent headache/pain, blocked sinuses, sinus pain, upper bronchial pain, endless mucus in my nose/throat/ears, my ears were plugged, and I felt tired and weak. I was given a chest X-ray to make sure I didn't have pneumonia/fluid in my lungs. I was told by a doctor that I had a cold/flu, caused by a virus, and I left the hospital with a free disposable mask, and nothing else, BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSIS WAS 'A VIRAL COLD/FLU WHICH DOESN'T RESPOND TO ANTIBIOTICS? There was no mention or apparent consideration of the possibility that I might also have a secondary or underlying bacterial infection, as well as the viral cold/flu. I wasn't aware that YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE MEDICAL ISSUE AT A TIME. Pardon me? The doctor I saw didn't seem to think that my immune system might need some help fighting off the primary viral cold/flu, and since they didn't bother to consider the possibility of a secondary bacterial infection, I left with NO prescription for either antibiotics for a possible secondary problem, or antivirals to help my immune system fight off the primary diagnosed viral infection. This 'pat on the head, and stop wasting our time' attitude during diagnosis and treatment was very disappointing, coming from a CPSO medical professional. It was simply assumed that I had just one problem, a viral cold/flu, and sent me home with nothing except the comment 'if it lasts more than a week, seek further help'. I'm a XX year old male with CLL, and even knowing my age, and that my immune system is compromised by the leukemia, they just shuffled me through the process, and out the door. I have always been prescribed antibiotics for any URTI throughout my life, and they have always shortened the duration of the cold/flu/sinusitis/bronchitis. I was shocked that it seems that the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX members are now afraid to 'over prescribe' antibiotics and antivirals out of fear of creating drug resistant 'super bugs'? When did 'superbug-phobia' take precedence over writing a simple prescription for something to assist a person's natural immune system recover from a severe cold/flu? How will doctors even know if the patient has a 'drug resistant bug' if they never write them a prescription for antibiotics? It's very disappointing, and I won't use or recommend XXX ER to anyone. I have spoken to several neighbors and acquaintances about my experience at the XXX ER, and was somewhat surprised to learn that I'm not the only person in XXXXXXX County that has had this type of treatment experience. If my doctor's office had been open when my condition got as bad as it was, I probably wouldn't have gone to XXX ER at all. It was during the XXXX holidays, unfortunately, and I had no choice as I was feeling that bad, and wanted to get something for it.

3237,Bluewater,Contact Requested,"Not so much the emergency room visit - besides the guy the triage nurse guy in ER on the phone with his angry wife talking about their mtg when we were sitting right there as he was checking my son's vitals & then ignored us because on the phone - but have a very BIG problem about how we were treated in ambulatory care! My son broke his wrist XXXXXXXX in XXXXXXX we did not know it was broken because he seemed fine - just a little sore drove home immediately & called our doctor on the XXXXXXXXXXX we were passing through asked what to do, they said they ahd just called and set us up with an appt @ ambulatory care for an x-ray so we didn't have to go into the ER I dropped the rest of the family off at home in XXXXXXXX and drove all the way back into XXXXXX immediately, for our appointment stopped at the doctors 1st to get slip to go to ambulatory care got to front of hospital where they made us gown up & put on masks with shields & gloves We fully understood why - as we did not really want to be in the hospital at this time either! We were sent down to ambulatory care and spoke with the gentleman at the 1st registration desk (XXXX maybe?) asked us ALL the normal questions ALONG with the Covid questions we were fine & normal, but did just get back home that day. He told us they would see us right away as we were the 1st in there. He told us to have a seat in their waiting room My X year old son & I did sat in a corner by ourselves as we did not want to be near anyone else who came in that could have something. (nor did we want to potentially give anything) As we waited there, a team member came in (XXXXXXXXXXX) and passed by us & looked. She stopped and asked ""oh those are fancy masks, where did you get those? I replied ""at the front door when we came in"" she said - ""oh, you have an appointment?"", I said ""yes"" She walked away and came right back and angrily said ""were you traveling?"" I replied yes well then all hell broke loose as she started yelling for us to ""get out of there"", and ""who let you in here"" ... ""get the hell out of here right now, you can't be in here"" Then started yelling down to XXXX asking why we were in there There was an older man who was sitting adjacent to us who said to me, ""it's OK honey, I have never seen anyone get kicked out of a hospital before"" and kind of chuckled I was so embarrassed, as she had created quite a scene and my son was now scared, tearing up, and hiding behind my back! At this point all in the waiting room were looking at us like we were sick - instead of just being in there for a cast! I was absolutely appalled. What kind of team member do you have working for you? I thought this was a great place to work when I was doing my co-op there, and wanted nothing more than to get a job there. And yet here is somebody who can just treat a patient like that?! I thought the XXXXXX hospital stood for more than that!

While I was talking she seemed to have little to no interest in what was being said. She said she would call the neurologist on call in XXXXXX. Which I could have done myself instead of calling an ambulance. The next time I saw her I brought up that his oxygen levels would drop anywhere from 80-90% when my child's eyes would flutter. She said that's okay I have already spoken with the neurologist on call and will be discharging your child. She gave us a medication dosage change to start immediately. We had an appointment with our pediatric neurologist that was already booked before this incident a few days later. The pediatric neurologist on call in XXXXXX was never informed about his oxygen levels dropping. My neurologist was very upset with our hospital visit as my child should have been kept and placed on oxygen until these eye flutters were controlled.

However, as a first time mom I felt completely overwhelmed and under prepared when we left the hospital. The nurses were typically good at answering my questions, but I also didn't really know what questions to ask. I noticed that if I didn't ask questions, there was no education/information offered. The discharge sheet on which I had to check off what I wanted to know about was not helpful at all. Everything I checked off on the sheet was gone through in about 10 minutes which left me feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Although everyone was helpful, I felt that everything they did was likely part of a checklist that they had for each patient. Everything seemed calculated, as if it were all about getting the paperwork done and ""checking off the boxes"". It would have been incredibly useful for someone to just check in with us when we arrived and simply ask what our experience and comfort level is with babies. At that point the care and patient education could have been tailored to our individual need.

3722,Bluewater,Service Alert,"The care by the nursing staff in the recovery are was poor I was basically left alone and in the dark (there about 25 hrs) and had to ring the buzzer for attention and help to use the bathroom I could hear the nurse on the phone for over 50 minutes complaining about COVID and union issues etc. she said she was busy and could not stay to help in the bathroom. There were 2 other nurses just sitting at the station and only one other patient in that area I find the young staff have no empathy compared to other staff. I know the hospital could do nothing about the COVID situation due to govt guidelines but I must state my opinion given a 2nd wave may come and were lessons learned? I am not clear as to how many OR's are in my hospital but I was told they were down to one only my surgery (breast cancer) was delayed twice due to COVID rules. Only loss of limb and life threatening were allowed during this time vs. elective surgery. The day of surgery I was bumped twice and surgery was delayed 6 ish hours. I was told there was a birth and an emergency. I believe I was later told there are 4 OR's at my hospital what sense does it make to close down so many of them and try to operate with so few. The collateral deaths because of this and other issues is unforgivable. My neighbours sister was one of them and would not have died in that case she was booted out of the hospital early. Told to go into a nursing home or whatever with only a very short notice she was forced to go home with no care and died of a heart attack alone days after I am sure this happened to many people and many who suffered unnecessarily when not receiving their scheduled surgeries. The govt chose to concentrate on COVID people only and the rest could go to hell basically to my knowledge the OR's and surgeons were not needed for that type of treatment you had hospitals with vacant rooms, nurses and doctors laid off etc who could have been saving patients if all OR's were kept operating. Some common sense was needed and not shutting down everything for the 3% of people who might or did get COVID in my town of 73,000 25 people died (seniors mostly in nursing homes) Let's hope lessons were learned and hospitals have more control of their practices based on their own area numbers.

XXXXXXXX, the nurse practitioner was excellent with me. The dr. that admitted me came & told me, I was in complete liver failure & had to be transferred to XXXXXX, which was completely not true! Upset my entire family! She needs to be checked into!! Dr. XXXXXX said he arranged a consult with an internist at XXXXXXXXXX I should have been transferred there but he had my husband drive me there. I sat for 4 hrs in ER in a cold & sick infested people room. Then internist admitted me telling me I was very ill. I had no white cells etc. My thrush was deep into my esophagus. I was 2 weeks in hospital (including XXXXXXXX) constant antibiotics IVs going into me. Methotrexate which I have been taking for years for RA, apparently what made me so ill as they said it OD me. Will be a long recovery period for me. Like to add that my stay in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, I felt pretty much ignored.

3953,Bluewater,Service Alert,"The older triage nurse is abrupt and condescending. I've experienced his 'bedside manner' myself and when taking my elderly mother in for health care. He basically mocks you or sighs when he feels you haven't answered a question to his satisfaction. I dislike how the registration area is set up. In this era of privacy concerns, the entire ED can hear you discuss your name/address/phone/emergency contact/health issues. There should be a more private area set-up for registration. The resident was very thorough, which was appreciated. I find that medical staff (nurses, doctors, residents) tend to gloss over the basics - not everyone knows how certain tests/medication/symptoms work, so a few extra seconds to explain would be greatly appreciated. Side note: my mother attended this ED 5 times over the course of 10 days (2 years ago) and was treated very poorly. She saw a different dr each time, who would say 'I don't know what's wrong with you, here are some meds, so go home'. Further tests were rarely ordered (one lower abdominal ultrasound, and a 'potential' CT scan in 7 weeks), despite severe pain, continual vomiting, and the inability to intake food for those 10 days - as a XXX year-old. In the end, we had to get her family dr involved to finally get her admitted to get testing done. After 10 days of vomiting and pain, the result was multiple pulmonary emboli, which could have killed her. But the ED drs just kept sending this senior citizen home to be someone else's problem another day. At that time, I did overhear one of the drs speaking with a nurse - they were concerned another patient had a heart attack, but weren't 100% sure. They were hesitating on following up for fear of being wrong and 'bothering' both the specialist and the 'nurse upstairs When I happened to be in the ED a few days after she was finally treated and released, one of the nurses who treated her on her 4th ED visit told me he didn't think she was going to live thru the night that evening. But yet the dr still sent her home with simple nausea meds that didn't help anything.

As well, I do not understand why, in a building that has an indoor courtyard, the which would most benefit from its use, is not situated there The road to recovery is long and it is very hard not to fall back into a depressive state when you are unable to get fresh air and can only walk up and down the hallway Please take this into consideration",2017-07-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Acute Mental Health Inpatient,"Access/Coord of Care, Physical Comfort",2017,832,,,,,,,,,,,,,,living-condition

Not being able to have any family here with me of course made everything so hard both ways, very stressful. When I left the hospital, not everything about the medications and the changes and such were properly explained to me, then I had to struggle to get the answers myself. Which I'm still trying to do, there needs to be more consistent care, or better communication.

When you are going there to get a migraine treatment would you want to sit in a waiting room for 3 hours before you got put into a room? With the size of XXXXXX and only one emergency department they need to have more nurses and doctors on duty to move people through the department faster, Most people when they go to the emergency department they have a problem that needs to be taken care of. Sitting and waiting as long as you have to at the hospital doesn't help!! I have sat at home and suffered with a migraine because i don't want to sit in a packed noisy waiting room to get looked at and a treatment.

What the hell is that. There should be at least 20- 30 chairs in a waiting room. I do recommend that this hospital have a walk in clinic added to it, that would cut about 60 - 70% of the patients that are going into your emergency department.

4173,Bluewater,Contact Requested,"This form was actually sent to my son - but since I had taken my granddaughter to the ER in XXXXX today and had a horrible experience I have decided to fill it out - my son's experience at XXXXXXXXX ER was much better than mine. On arriving at ER the waiting room had 4 people all waiting, we were registered by a very unfriendly nurse sent to wait in designated area. Although I must admit she couldn't have been that miserable because she sure could laugh and carry on with her co-workers - About an hour after our wait (broken arm on granddaughter another yount girl came in with same (broken arm). But the mother had on scrubs was obviously employed by hosp - she was quickly taken to xray without waiting. We were then taken to room, asked for an ice pack and was told 'I will see if I can find one' - an hour later she finally returns with one (approx 2 hours in at this point), now we wait another hour finally a doctor arrives, says she will send us to xray but first we will get pain meds. Finally after another hour nurse comes in with meds, and we go to xray - wait there then back to ER and wait another 2 hours - All toll our wait and experience was 6+ hours and very frustrating and seeing the other young girl with same broken arm leave in under one hour, was more than unfair. Just because a nurse goes to ER her treatment should be the same + would not have been as near infuriating if we all waited the same. In all of our wait times we were never in areas that were packed with patients. Being that I was with a younger girl you would think a nurse registering us could at least made some effort to make my granddaughter feel at ease. The people around me were all angry and saying we would be treated as humans and not all corralled like animals left to rot. In closing my start to finish at the XXXXXX emergency dept earned a (-1) that's minus one! Why was the other girl out in less than one hour? I watcher her leave!!! I realize priority goes to the sickest but certainly not to the favourite or friend. In closing I will admit 'XXX' the volunteer rated a 10 and I was very sad to see him go. I did make some friends during our wait times as we all were getting very frustrated. Even the lady with the bleeding head had to wait for the young girl and her mom!! Tell me the fairness there.

The IV didn't even drip so I got dehydrated and felt horrible. Then when I told them they couldn't believe it, maybe if one of them came in to check me they would of know. So I was already nervous to get my surgery done and then that didn't work so I was upset and crying. My husband had to calm me down in the room, they take you before surgery. The anesthesiologist ended up giving me an IV while I was going into my surgery! Finally when I got home in XXXXXX, I was throwing up from not having a proper IV. A few weeks later I got an infection and didn't feel right I had a lump near my incision & and all my doctor said was I don't know what that could be and was in my room for 2 mins!

Doctor did not listen nor care though stated would give 5 days of pain relief to help that was a lie. 4 people heard & witnessed what she said, then, lied when pharmacist explained meds & what dr said was not there when confronted (nicely) doctor would not stay, explain nor, suggest anything.

The first time we were there a doctor did a chest ultrasound to check if his lung had collapsed. I spoke with my husbands lung specialist about it who laughed and said that would show nothing and informed us that the other doctor must have been trying to rush us out. Which he was. Nothing was done that time. My husband took our son back 2 days later because the symptoms had not gone away or got any better. They sat in the waiting room for at least an hour before being seen by a doctor. This is unacceptable. For no reason should anyone with chest pains have to sit and wait the way my son did. Especial not a XX yr old child. He is still having chest pains but does not want to go back to your hospital and be mistreated.

4534,Bluewater,Service Alert,"When I was admitted to Labour and Delivery, my waters had ruptured and I was admitted upon arrival. After a few hours I was informed I would be induced, once the process started, it happened quickly (I have very fast labour and delivery) and I was having regular contractions, a new nurse came in to cover my previous nurses break and it was found that my baby was in fact footling breech and no one knew this or checked before they induced me. I was then sent for an emergency C-section. If I hadn't had a new nurse arrive and notice the shape of my stomach and then check the baby's position there could have been more serious problems. The nurses were then given a lesson on how to determine the baby's position while I had people running around to prep me for surgery. It's very scary to think this could have been missed and my labour could of progressed to the point of serious complications for myself and my baby. Your Breast is Best Agenda needs work. The nursing staff was extremely reluctant to allow me to give my baby a small amount of formula while I was breastfeeding. By the second night of my stay, I could hear my baby's stomach growling, she was very hungry and upset. At this point I had nothing to give her from my breasts, she wasn't swallowing anything while latched, when asked about giving some formula to comfort the baby until my milk came in the nurse made it clear that it was not recommended and that I would need to sign a waiver to say I understood the risk of formula. The process to try to even have access to formula to comfort my hungry child was made to seem impossible and my husband and I didn't even debate the issue because we were exhausted and having to fill out paperwork to just feed my child is completely unacceptable. What would be helpful would be non judgement about the method in which a parent wants to feed their child. Fed is best, and if that means a parent wants formula we shouldn't have to sign anything, or be made to feel as if we don't know what is best for our child. There are so many risks/ health issues associated with a mothers late milk development, that can seriously harm a newborn.

4657,Bluewater,Service Alert,"XXXXXXXXXXXXX To whom it may concern: I am an older man and I grow tired of having doctors, nurses, whoever looking down their noses because I am on pain medications, ""opioids."" They were prescribed by a doctor (qualified) who understood the amount of pain I was in. My son died in XXXX from cancer and at his request we donated his remains to the hospital. I did not kill any of those kids who are dying as a result of overdoses. If even 1 person dies this way it is tragic! This is a mental health issue. These people need an education and the pushers need life sentences but doctors and the government has made us feel shame with our pain. I personally have at least 7 discs cracked & bulging, my neck, shoulder and I suffer from severe migraine headaches. I suffer from depression and intense anxieties. I lost a son in XXXX and I have a XX yr old and a XX yr old son I am raising. I cry every day from the pain. I have to use a wall to straighten my back just to be able to send the boys to school. The pain meds are an enabler, an enabler to be able to give my grandsons some semblance of life. I have my family and they are counting on me. If these meds are taken away (P.S. I've been on morphine & others with severe reactions to everything else). In less than weeks after meds are reduced & eliminated I WILL NOT be able to function and I will be of NO use to anyone! Keep letting people, doctors, etc. make us feel like poop! Because we don't feel the world closing in on us already!

4658,Bluewater,General,"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX I arrived at the emergency at around 10 PM on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. I had a catheter as a result of prostate cancer surgery (XXXXXXXXXXXX). The catheter was blocked or plugged and leaking urine around the attachment area, causing severe pain. I told the attendant behind the first wicket and she said I would have to wait in line for your number to register. It wasn't able to sit due to the excruciating pain, so I stood. When I met with the registration attendant, I explained my circumstance, and asked if she would call Dr. XXXXXX. She responded by saying that the procedure is to use the emergency doctors to address emergency dept medical needs. The registration attendant did give me a towel to stuff in my pants to help contain the leaking around the catheter. I remained in the cue to see the doctor. Around 12:30 AM the catheter block finally started to release and my leg bag starting to fill, the pain started to ease. I was finally able to sit down as the severe pain finally subsided. I stayed at emergency, as I didn't know if I had internal damage from the pressure of the catheter or as well as damage to the catheter. A nurse came around 1:00 m, and took me to a patient cubical to wait for the doctor. The nurse checked my blood pressure and temperature and came back about 15 minutes later, to check the amount of liquid in my bladder. The doctor came to see me around 2:45 AM. He apologized for my long wait. He said he was the only doctor on duty that night and he had seen over 20+ patients. He checked me, and said that he wasn't a urologist, wasn't sure he could have helped me, if the catheter hadn't unplugged itself. The doctor and staff were very professional, courteous & friendly, which I very much appreciated. I wished the emergency doctor had seen me when I first got registered and then he may have called a urologist out to help and perhaps gave me some pain medication. I spent a good two and a half hours waiting in pain, I don't think this shouldn't happen. I hope in future that your emergency procedures will allow the emergency doctor to see some flexibility in a case like mine, where a urologist (specialist) maybe required to be called out to attend to a patient's medical problem like mine. It was a long night at the emergency for me and a number of others seeking help, with only having one doctor on duty. I don't believe this is fair for the doctor, the staff, or the people seeking medical attention. I left the hospital at 3:15 AM, five hours is a long time to be at emergency.

4803,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"Although I believe I received good care, and I have no complaints about the care that I personally received, I rated the ED with 'definitely no', in response to the question, 'would not recommend the ED to family & friends?' for the following reasons: I observed a triage nurse being very disrespectful as she yelled repeatedly at an elderly woman who kept pulling her mask down in order to speak. The nurses were neither polite nor compassionate about the fact that no visitors were allowed, they just kept saying, 'no visitors allowed' abruptly and coldly (like automatons) to each person who arrived with someone else. They also use medical jargon that very few people understand. I am a XXXXX; I know what 'triage' means, but very few people, unless they are healthcare providers or watch medical dramas, know the meaning of that word. The word triage should be defined in a sign on the wall, and nurses should explain what it means when they use it.

4850,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"d Professor of Endocrinology at XXXXXXXXXXXX Hospital in XXXXXX. Those of us with pituitary disease deserve better treatment than this. Our lives are on the line. I feel that I deserve follow up and dialogue, so this will never happen again. XXXXXXXXXXXXHaving been through the XXXXXX, I am well known with my rare disease of Hypopituitarism..followed by specialists in XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. I have been admitted many times to The XXX. On the day of XXXXXXXX, I was treated with disrespect, sent home in pain in an unstable condition. The female Hospitalist did not understand my condition, nor did she pay any attention to the letter that I carry from my Endocrinologist in XXXXXX. At this time my husband was not allowed in to the ER with me, and as I was in Adrenal Crisis, I was confused, in pain and also in a hypertensive crisis. I was accused of being a drug seeker, after being treated with Emergency IV Solu Cortef. Back and leg pain is explained in the letter that I carry, along with my Emergency Injectable Solu Cortef. I pleaded with the female physician that I needed more Solu Cortef, and that I was still in pain. I was confused and thought that I had vomited my last two pain pills, as they were due to be filled at the Pharmacy on the next day. I was confused. I was not out of meds at all. I had my husband on my cell phone, but they would not speak to him. He was very upset as he always accompanies me during Crisis, as I do get confused, and as the letter explains, I can quite easily fall into coma and die without the correct treatment. I do not remember the name of the young female doctor, but she had the nurses convinced that I was not really ill. They told me to put on my clothes and leave, all the while I was crying and telling them how frightened I was. When I asked for assistance to the door to meet my husband, one of them said..you know the way. Once home my husband proceeded to give me extra Intramuscular Injections of Solu Cortef that we must keep on hand for Emergencies. He administered Intramuscular Gravol as well. We also have it on hand when I am vomiting during an attack. My BP finally came down and I was able to take in oral fluids. My endocrinologist, Dr XXXXXXXXXXXX at XXXXXXXXXXXX was very disturbed when told of my treatment. Because my husband knew what to do, I did not lapse into coma, and finally came around, frightened and confused. The female physician wrote a letter to my pain clinic in XXXXXX, giving a completely erroneous description of the situation. I can tell you that I was on Pod 3, and would not have gone except for my vomiting and need for Emergency Meds. This physician had no understanding of my rare pituitary disease, and I believe that she did not even contact an Internist. She put my life at great risk. I am a retired RN, and I have never been treated this way in my life. In order to stay alive, I must self administer subcutaneous Solu Cortef into my abdomen four or five times daily. I am immune suppressed because of the steroids, and never would have gone to the ER during the start of the Covid pandemic. I was in trouble, and because I was confused, alone and in pain, I was treated with complete disrespect, and told to go home while still very unstable. My tears and panic did nothing. I was not myself, as I was slipping into delirium, and if I raised my voice it was due the complete fear that I was subjected to. I am not a rude person, ever. The Internists at XXX know me well, and are familiar with the need for follow up and quick treatment. I have a very rare condition, and now am completely panicked that we will have to drive to XXXXXX should I slip into Adrenal Crisis once more. I am so ashamed that I was treated this way. XXXXXXXXX is our home, and never did we ever expect that my life would be put in such danger because of the arrogance and judgement of a Doctor and at least two RNs. The whole situation was disgraceful. I hope that you will address this traumatic day. We are quite willing to reach some sort of explanation. The people of XXXXXXXXX should never have their lives put at risk because of stubborn and judgemental medical staff. I know that Dr XXXXXXX would be willing to discuss this with you.

The following day I took my daughter to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for a second opinion where she was admitted for 2 weeks, was treated by 4 teams, and required an emergency surgery.

4892,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"Emergency department and C and Treat were exceptional. I had a broken wrist and they did the best they could to manage the pain during treatment. Unfortunately I required surgery which could not be done the same day as the accident. I was told I would be called the next day with a time for surgery the following day. I was never called and there was no way to follow up with anyone (because it was a weekend?). I was called the XXXXXX and told to attend the orthopaedic clinic XXXXXXX morning at 9:30 am, nothing to drink or eat after midnight so I'd be ready for surgery. I had surgery around 6 pm that evening. Dr. XXXX had ordered fluids and pain medication to help until I received surgery. I was taken to day surgery in a wheelchair and sat in the waiting room without any medication from about 1:15 until approximately 4 pm. So not only did I wait 5 days for surgery, nobody looked at the doctors orders before I was taken in for surgery at which point I had had nothing for pain since 9:30 pm the night before, and no water or other fluids since 11 pm the night before, so I was very upset and in a lot of pain by the time they took me in to prep for surgery. So emergency care was 10 out of 10, follow up left a lot to be desired. If surgery can not be done when the patient is told it will be, why can't anyone communicate this to the patient? Why is there no way for the patient to follow-up when not called by the hospital? ( we did try and call, after a run around messages were left but no call backs). And why did no one in day surgery look at my chart and provide fluids and pain medication while I was waiting? Tried to bring this to their attention 2 to 3 times as was told that I was not forgotten, but had to wait because I was an add on.

5018,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"I am writing this for my daughter, XXXX (X years old), who received care at the ER a few weeks ago. XXXX had appendicitis which was surgically managed within 36 hours of presenting to the ER. I cannot stress enough what good care we received overall at XXX. With one exception the entire staff was excellent: Caring, competent and kind. The only issue (echoed in my survey answers) was that we waited a really long time after being triaged. There was no bed available for us, so we sat in the main ER waiting room for almost 7 hours. XXXX was in terrible pain and vomiting profusely the whole time. I know this was not the fault of the ER staff - there just wasn't room in any part of the ER. This is, however, a huge problem. Despite the fact that she was an emergent case, we were not seen by a doc or given pain meds for a really long time! Further, there was some confusion about how to manage her waste (vomit) - the only grumpy nurse we encountered during our stay gruffly told me to dump it in the washroom and wash the basin myself - I have no issue with doing this from a parent perspective, but from an infection control perspective it seemed like an odd choice (particularly during covid!) - during our 7 hours in the wait room I did not see the washroom being cleaned, even though we repeatedly dumped basins of vomit in the toilet. Also - we were not, at any time, tested for covid, despite the fact that my daughter was febrile and vomiting. However, despite these gaps, I need to be clear how wonderful everyone else was, how hard they tried to make our visit comfortable and what good care we received - I am very grateful! A special shout out to the kind nurses in the see and treat, the equally kind nurses on the peds floor, and Dr. XXXXXX and his excellent surgical team (I'm really sorry - I tried to get everyone's names but it was a fairly stressful time!). One last small note: I wonder if it might be possible to have just one TV on at at time in the wait room and to turn that TV down a bit? Both TVs were blaring different shows (news and Sponge Bob respectively) and it just amped up our level of distress and agitation - particularly as we were there most of the night.",2020-08-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Brantford Site,"Access/Coord of Care, Admit/Registration, Emergency Dept, Emotional Support, Housekeeping/Room, Physical Comfort, Respect to Patient, Infection Prevention &amp; Control",2020,2198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

All that was done was to give her a puffer which I had already done and was capable of doing at home.

About an hour later I went through registration and then waited another two hours to be brought into the back. I was in the hallway. About another hour later a nurse came by and I think he did a great job of asking me what was wrong and how I was feeling. He got me some pain medication and left. I did not see a doctor until shift change around 6 am. She said she was ordering a CT scan for me but it would be a bit. I saw a few nurses throughout the day but it was several hours in between when they would check on me. 6 hours later, I asked the 3rd doctor I had seen wandering around what was the problem as others who had come in after me for CT scans had already left and come back and been discharged. He said they were busy. As this was a recurring condition (Crohns flare up/ fistula) I asked if this was how long I had to wait that he could just give me the antibiotics they always give me and stop wasting my time. He said he was sorry and that they were very busy. About a half hour later, I was told that my CT scan was planned for 45 minutes from then. An hour and a half later I got the scan and waited. The doctor told me to wait for the GI specialist. There were two of them. The younger one told me what they thought was up and was going to write me a prescription. The older one showed up later and was generally rude and dismissive of what I was telling him. He made me get another blood test before I could leave. At the end I had been there for 23.5 hours.

5106,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,I had a simple problem that needed treatment reasonably quickly. I had put fudex cream on actinic keratosis on my ankle. It formed a scab. After three weeks the scab came off when I stepped out of the shower. Blood stream out about 12 inches and covered the floor before I noticed it. I wrapped a tensor bandage around it. When my wife came home a few minutes later she took me directly to the emergency room to see what need to be done to stop it appropriately. After being seen immediately by the front desk emerg nurse I was sent a few minutes later to the New See and Treat Department. The nurse on duty cleaned me up and rebandaged me. Then shortly thereafter a physicians physician came and took a look. She said first thing to try was a chemical cauterization. She didn't think that did the trick so she put in a few stiches and that was it. I was in and out in 35 minutes. Very happy with my treatment. It's now a month later and the scab and stitches fell off a few days ago. It looks good as new. I am writing this because I think the See and Treat is a great idea and long overdue. Whoever instituted is due this pat on the back. Well done.

A towel was laid over the vomit the entire time I was waiting (over an hour). Then the waiting room overfilled with people coming to be seen, the gentleman who sat beside me stunk so bad I had to turn my head to breathe. Then a drugged up moron came into the emergency department and started to threaten people with a fire extinguisher which he grabbed from the sign in counter area. Of course you now have security and police involved and telling sick people to get up and move back.

I was given a blanket upon request. A hallway ultrasound was done of my bladder twice, vitals taken and then waited for 5 hours to be seen by a doctor. At that point, further testing was ordered and a blood work taken for what I was told a full CBC. Once those results came back which was 2 and half hours later, I was provided an IV fluids and IV antibiotics. I stayed in the hospital an additional 3 hours or so for until I was able to void without significant blood in urine. I was given an antibiotic to leave and a script to fill that evening. I was feeling better, but somewhat concerned for the 45 minute drive home. I made it fine and was better within a few days. One negative thing that happened, is in the rush to get to emergency, I had forgotten my cell phone and asked to use one but was denied initially and redirected to get out of the bed in the hallway and go to the waiting room to use the public phone by one nurse in the nursing station. I was bleeding quite a bit and did not feel that to be safe, the answer was still no. In the end, my primary nurse provided me use of the cell phone to call my family to let them know where I was as it was not a planned visit to emergency.

As an example; it's an easy thing for a nurse to tell a patient - 'please sit here and a doctor will be with you when he is free' - or - 'when you are finished in radiology, please return to this waiting room and someone will be with you after the doctor has viewed your xrays'.

I then sat in a room by myself for almost an hour or more, I finally went out into the hall, ask what I was waiting for. That is the first I had any idea what I was waiting for and all I was told the doctor would be in, she was doing a procedure. The PA came in half an hour of so later, he was very nice and that is when I heard my arm and back pain was probably a reaction to the COVID shot I received a few days earlier.

5212,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"I understand that this city has an opioid crisis and that a few have ruined it for many. To have a policy devoid of bed side manner, feeling, empathy and understanding because it's an easy fix to not allow any opioid prescriptions to be filled is simply ludicrous. I am a XX year old man with an obvious injured gait. Here's what I explained to the physician. I had a family doctor for 35 years. He retired over a year ago. I have been on a waiting list for 13 months for another family doctor. I was injured at work in XXXX, which involved permanent injury to my spine. I had my entire XXXX file with me along with my entire medical file from my old family doctor. I had my on line doctor appointment email in which I explained that he filled out all of my prescriptions except the Tramadol/tramacet which he could not because it is under the controlled substance act and I need to physically be seen by a physician. Since none of the doctors at the 3 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXs would fill the prescription and they advised me that the emergency doctors at the hospital were the only physician that could do that, imagine my surprise after waiting to be seen for 6 and a half hours with a mask because of COVID 19, when the physician also said she would not. I wasn't even getting a full prescription filled. I was just trying to get enough to get me by until my new appointment with my pain specialist at XXXXXXXXXXXX (XXXX) at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. My appointment was on XXXXXXXXX and could have shown it on my email but the physician was not even interested in looking at it. She said they have a policy to never give a prescription for any controlled substance. I asked if a colleague might look at my case in a different light as I had all my things in order and couldn't understand even with a few pills in the prescription bottles from XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with my name and the doctor from XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX on it, that she could see I wasn't some punk kid looking for drugs. Right away, she got all defensive and said , her colleague will follow the same rules as her and will not fill it. I even asked what my options were since I have no family doctor, no clinical physician and now no physician even at the hospital to fill it. She wrote me a prescription for asa or something and I did not fill it. I actually still have it. The point being , any physician being well educated can pretty much tell who is trying to kite the system and who is genuinely legitimate. Having a catch all rule shows no empathy or desire in any way to look after a patient. Just an easy out for the doctor and on to the next guy. I honestly had to go to my XXX Mr. XXXXX who got someone at XXXXXXXXXXXXXX who directed me to have my pharmacist fill out a temporary prescription to get me enough pills until my XXXXXXXXX appointment with my pain physician at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The emergency physician could not do what my pharmacist can?? Really?? The system is very broken because addicted people have broken it. They no longer treat you as an individual just as a number.

My head bounced like a bowling ball off the floor. I ended up covered in small tables and my water glasses had soaked me in water. Luckily I had my cell phone. I contacted my husband - he came home and being unable to lift me from severe pain in my right hip he called the ambulance. The were efficient & kind and got me immediately to the ER. I was asked questions then left in a hallway. The dr. spoke to me, sent me for an x-ray on my hip and NO ONE checked my head. I was in an adult diaper. On the way to x-ray I over-soaked the diaper. When returned to the hall I asked numerous times for it to be changed. My clothing was covered in urine. This mess was never cleaned up - when they released me I was put into a wheelchair and placed alone outside, sitting there until my husband came. I had to have him put a garbage bag on the seat. I sat outside alone in 90 degree weather with urine running down my legs. No one assisted my husband to put me in our pick-up truck. After that fall I was sent home with only 90 pain tablets for intense pain in my head. - Remember no one ever checked my head. My left side was not working. I could not stand or use my left hand. I had to be carried to the bathroom at home by my husband who was given NO training in how to move me. Because of this POOR care I received my diagnosis that came on my 2nd visit to the ER that has been entirely missed & ignored. XXXXXXXXXXX I went again by ambulance and it was thought I had a stroke. Nope - XXXXXXXXXXX I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Brain Mets. Had anyone x-rayed my head, they would have known this on XXXXXXXXX.

When the physician finally did see me he did an ultrasound and was more interested in playing with that machine then my symptoms. He never asked me a single question about what brought on my symptoms. He never even asked me how I was. He conversed on the use of opiates in the community. I have never used opiates or narcotics of any type. I am a XX yr old woman who had severe abdominal pain. He told me he couldn't find anything and discharged me despite the fact I had trouble trying not to faint. I left the ER and was still sick the next day. I was able to get into my family physician who looked at my x-ray report and told me I had a bowel obstruction and needed to see a surgeon.

5309,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,I was very grateful for the compassionate and non-judgmental care I received. I was out of my long standing pain medication due to a missed appointment with my family doctor. In this climate of opioid crisis I half expected to be flagged as drug seeking drug dependant but I was treated wonderfully ... the nurses even brought me a dose while I was in the waiting room waiting to be called. The ER physician prescribed me enough medicine to last until I could f/u with my doctor and did not grill me about taking narcotic pain killers or try and suggest switching my meds. He asked a couple questions about my pain and injury and asked if Percocet was working well for me. I have a compressed nerve in my lower back from a traumatic injury ... although Im in severe pain daily and need strong medication to control it the opioid crisis has caused me to be treated like a junkie by healthcare professionals on more than one occasion.

5375,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"In the past, I have had issues with my Mental Health. When coming to the Hospital with severe pain in my chest and a fall on the floor, my husband called an ambulance to get me there right away. That was my first visit which is going on three weeks ago. I have very positive things to say about the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX but on this particular night I felt from the nurses, behind the desk was nothing but laughter, swearing and I do not appreciate hearing about my past and history of depression and anxiety. The F word was used often which I am aware that it is a common word used with the younger generation but it truly bothered me. I do have Cervical Dystonia and I am seeing a doctor at the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX every three weeks for the care of that. XXXXXXXXX does not have enough doctors who have the knowledge of what this is. (or the nursing staff). Many years back I suffered angina and had an angiogram at XXXXXXX's Hospital where XXXXXXXXX sent me and continued on Nitro. On my second visit, by ambulance and sent by a telehealth nurse,(I did not want to go) the ambulance driver gave me two baby chewable aspirins, also nitro spray. He spoke with my husband and my history and with each spray with him and in the hospital, I was starting to feel much better. That doctor was amazing and I am pleased to say because of him I am getting a stress test and I will be going to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX to see a heart specialist. He also did a chest x-ray, also blood tests. Dr XXXXXXXXX, I believe was his name and I thank him for his kindness and helping us get to the hospital. Not all of my TIA's have been confirmed. I have had two blood clots in my lungs and I thank your Hospital for finding them. Why does Mental Health Stigma have to be so bad for patients every time? After my mom past away I had a terrible breakdown - who wouldn't. Many years ago my past rape came out when the man was arrested, I needed ongoing help. I have seen my GP and my psychiatrist since the first visit. Both want the pain and racing of my heartbeat to be investigated/ Anxiety and racing heartbeat are two different things. I ask you from the bottom of my heart, for my cousin's sake who is no longer here to speak, and no it was not your Hospital.

5431,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"Let me begin by first saying that the survey does not specifically distinguish which particular visit date to which I'm filling the survey results on. If I were to refer to my visit on XXXXXXXXXXX as opposed to my visit of XXXXXXXXXXX, my choices for each question would be quite different. On XXXXX, I was misdiagnosed by one doctor as having a possible intercostal muscle pain issue, and ended up returning three days later with much the same intense pain on XXXXX. Another more perceptive doctor properly diagnosed my condition as having a pulmonary embolism, to which I was promptly treated with the appropriate blood thinner. I feel mistakes such as this, and the inability to notify the first doctor of his mistake leads me to believe that corrective action and adequate feedback are not a priority with the medical profession. His misdiagnosis could have potential put me in grave danger, as PE's can be fatal if not taken care of in time. The condition in emerg on XXXXX are not the same ones that I have filled out this survey (referring to XXXXXXXXXXX). It is all well and good to present me with a survey that purports to take health care seriously for the citizens of XXXXXXXXX, but my personal experience over the last five years shows me that going to emerg here is nothing more than a crap shoot, with wide variations in service delivery. At times I would give the hospital and staff a 9 out of 10, and other times, barely a 2. This lack of consistency is perplexing, and not solely dependent on heavy case loads and busy periods. As a patient, set apart from the daily goings-on at this hospital, I fail to see why such a wide variation in quality health services can't be rectified, or possibly even identified. I have already received many of these surveys, and filled them out where others would just toss them in the garbage. Most people have already resigned themselves to accepting the current level of treatment, good or bad. I have also noted that certain numbers of patients waiting in emerg are chronic complainers, discontent the moment they arrived, and expect premium treatment within minutes. I assure you I'm not one of them. I realize it takes a team, one that works well together, and has the resources to provide the services we've come to expect for our tax dollars. Overall, I'd say there has been some noticeable improvement at the XXX, but feel it is still far from the mark of being above average. The problems are many, and even little changes would be a move in the right direction. But unless those things can be properly identified, nothing is going to change there, in my opinion. Surveys like this one are basically rigged to get the results it expects to get, and are so non-specific that the questions could be chopped down to three questions and still get the same result. Why would one's sexual orientation even matter when it comes to health care, or that I'm white, green or purple? Is that how health care issues are framed in this country? Until the survey questionnaire is amended, this will be the last one I will fill out.",2017-01-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Brantford Site,"Access/Coord of Care, Doctor/Physician, Emergency Dept, Physical Comfort",2017,3078,,Medical Error and Incompetence (Misdiagnosis),,,,,,,,Max,Before December 2 2022,,,no_sdoh

5468,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"My last visit was during the Covid-19 pandemic, for a migraine headache I had for almost 4 straight days. I was immediately tested for the virus before even being asked why I was there. when I was finally taken to the see and treat area I was left in a treatment room for quite a long time before anyone attempted to talk to me. When someone finally did come in to talk to me I had my scarf covering my eyes because the lights were making the migraine worse to the point that I thought I was going to throw up. I then was left again to wait to be seen by someone before being moved to a treatment room with medical reclining chairs for an I.V to be inserted and started, during all of this still covering my eyes with my scarf because of the light. The first medication that was given with the saline made me very uncomfortable, hot and full body itching (I have no idea what it was, or if that would be considered an allergic reaction). I was given two other medications after it the first one took about 20 minutes to work and stop the uncomfortable reaction I was having. The other medication took a bit longer to work but was effective in getting rid of the migraine headache. I am not sure how busy the hospital was that day but from what I saw and remember it wasn't that busy at all and the door was left open on both rooms I was in and I could see and hear hospital staff chatting at the computer station about their personal lives in no hurry to treat any patients who were waiting to be seen. I fully understand that we are in a very serious pandemic but not talking to patients and leaving them in rooms like that doesn't help alleviate anxiety they may be having about being at the hospital during this time.

I do not suffer from migraines, and I am not an alarmist, if I was at ER, I had a genuine serious concern for my wellbeing. I was scared and afraid of possible explanations, ie stroke, clot, aneurism. I never go to ER unless I consider it an emergency. I have the utmost respect for all our health care workers. She stood in front of me as I explained my concerns and before any kind of vitals checked etc. She's like ya, I don't think so. Her tone was condescending and rude. We went in to check vitals, and even though my BP was 164/92. She's like that's not high. I responded. It is very high for me, I usually run with very low BP. Pulse was also up. Anyway, she sent me around the corner to the wait and see room. When upon entry I was the fourth person there. After speaking with the second nurse and she was recording the details of why I was there, she was excellent. Then I was sent back out to wait. I sat for over 4 hours with no one seeing me. I understand triage, but there did not appear to be anyone in more or less distress than myself. I firmly believe because I was sitting quietly, waiting patiently, and not causing any distress they just took everyone else. I was very upset and got up and left. Which I have never done before. Again! Myself and my family have the most respect for the staff at the XXX. We have always received quality and compassionate care. This was one rare occasion, and I hope and pray it never happens again to anyone. I was truly disappointed and angered. I believe if the first nurse had taken my concerns more seriously and not poo pooped me within the first 5 minutes of seeing me, again even before sitting down to record my vitals , etc ... perhaps I would have received some assistance and seen a physician.

5551,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"On XXXXXXXXXXXXX around 4:30 pm I was quickly brought into the ER. I was suffering from breathing difficult, severe wheezing, discomfort, and heightened heart rate. I told the doctors I had taken the inhaler more than prescribed on the canister (2 puffs as necessary no more than 4 times a day) I had probably taken the two puffs about 5 times since 5:30 am that morning. This was acknowledged as the cause of my elevated heart rate and I was given a nebulizer mask, prescribed prednisone for the first time, had an X-ray taken and shipped out right away I was out by 6 pm. My husband drove me to the pharmacy to pick up prednisone and another inhaler and went home. Still struggled with difficulty breathing, and constant wheezing so I went back to the hospital. I still had an elevated heart rate, but had not taken any inhalers since before coming to the hospital earlier. I told the nurse at the desk I've never experienced this before, have history of asthma but never this severe, inhaler, the prescribed prednisone and the nebulizer mask has not improved breathing quality at all. I feel like my heart rate is high because I can't catch my breath. They instantly bring me back to the emergency room. Doctor greets me by saying 'oh you're back I was going to call you in the morning - your x ray shows excess air in your chest cavity which suggests there might be a hole in your lung' doctor continues to say 'there is no urgency you can come back in the morning for another X-ray'. I told her I really don't feel well and asked if she could help. She said she would take another x ray now but no one can read until the morning. She tries to send me home. I told her I didn't feel comfortable. Could not catch my breath. *I'd like to note at no point did she listen to my breathing* Once again she tried to tell me I was fine and to leave. I told her I can't catch my breath and can't stop wheezing I've never had an experience where my inhaler couldn't help me. She said 'you have asthma and you've never had that? You're lucky. It's normal you should go home and rest'. Still struggling the catch my breath I asked for another nebulizer mask to help me breath. She put that on, did an ekg to check my heart, said I was fine and told me I must just be using my inhaler wrong. She comes back once more and asked if I was comfortable. I responded by saying I still wasn't well. She asked if I used the pill, and I said yes. She said perhaps I have a blood clot in my lung, as it is common among XX year olds on the pill. (This was frightening to me, and strange because an extra had already shown excess air in chest cavity). I asked if that was normal as I've been on the pill for over 5 years and recently had a check up with my doctor and said all was fine. She insisted it was common and gave me blood thinners and told me to come back in morning for a ct scan. She tried to bully me into leaving and said 'I send XX year old women home with blood thinners, no problem you'll be fine. We will call in the morning to do a test, just go home and rest'. Nurse came by with blue ventolin inhaler and box tool to help get the medicine into me. Doctor suspects I am inhaling the inhaler wrong (I've had asthma from age XXXX and never had a problem, but she insisted the nurse show me by measuring my breath before, then administering the inhaler through the box, then measuring after) I took a deep breath, tried to exhale and coughed around 120 mg of breath on the scale that goes to 800 mg and I'm told the average person blows 400 mg. The nurse gives me the inhaler and there is no improvement. At that point he returns with the doctor who says I must stay over night because of my breath reading. This was around 11 pm. I was completely unattended after that, not checked on once until 8 am the next morning. I lied uncomfortable in the hall all night. The morning doctor said the X-ray I had at 10 pm the night before confirmed the diagnosis of pneumdiastinum which showed up on the initial X-ray taken at 4:30 pm. At this point my breathing had not improved and my throat and neck were in agonizing pain. The doctor said I would be admitted but saw no need for a ct scan and cancelled that. When breakfast came around they gave me blood thinners, which I said I don't need because I've been diagnosed with something other than a blood clot and the nurse insisted I take them. I was admitted and despite addressing it an additional two more times I was continuously administered blood thinners. My doctor the following morning re scheduled a ct scan to locate the leak in my lung, and it made no sense to him nor I that my initial ct was cancelled. My nurses were kind and caring. The doctor who handled the end of my stay was incredible, arranging for a lung specialist, explaining things to me, asking about medications and my medical history (all questions and treatment that I did not receive on the first 2-3 days of my stay). I left feeling cared for upon my release, however that does not make up for the initial days of my hospital stay. I feel I was given unnecessary blood thinners, dismissed by doctors and nurses, neglected in the halls, and lost in the system. It boggles my mind how the er doctor did not once take out a stethoscope upon my return to the hospital on XXXXXXX at 10 pm when I had persistent breathing difficulties. I would not recommend the XXXXXXXXXXXX to anyone, the entire night I felt like a burden, being rushed out so someone else could have my bed. I am a XX year old, XX at the time with no prior history of illness in recent years, and was pleading for someone to listen to the fact that something was wrong.",2017-04-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Brantford Site,"Access/Coord of Care, Doctor/Physician, Emergency Dept, Information/Education, Medication/Prescrip, Nurse/Nurse aide, Physical Comfort, Respect to Patient",2017,5654,,Medical Error and Incompetence (Misdiagnosis),Wait Times,Neglecting/Ignoring Patients,,,,,,Sakeina,Before December 2 2022,,,no_sdoh

5707,Brant Community Healthcare System,Emergency,"The Emergency physician referred my daughter XXXXX to the on call pediatrician who first noticed the low sodium which ultimately led to her following up with another pediatrician at the XXX three days later, which led to her being transferred to XXXXXXXX and from there she received her diagnosis of a rare autoimmune disease and is doing very well now. I am very grateful for the care XXXXX received, however overall from a paediatric point of view it was a terrible experience. There was not enough nursing staff from the moment she was brought back to the cardiac/critical care section. A life labs nurse came first who was unable to get her bloodwork on her own so as the parent I had to assist her by pushing the vials into place to collect the blood. This took two tries and she told me that another nurse would be in to put in her I.V. I couldn't believe that she was going to be poked three times unnecessarily. The I.V. should have been put in first and the bloodwork taken from the I.V. From there the nursing staff seemed to be very overwhelmed and understaffed. There was a very kind janitor who was smiling and trying to help patients and families be at ease. The radiologist technician was super kind and relatable which was awesome. However, after the ultrasound came back clear XXXXX was transferred to the hallway to wait for the pediatrician I asked that she not be moved but I was told there was no other option and her space was needed now by someone more critical than she was. There was no privacy and she was left extremely vulnerable in a hospital gown on a bed with an IV in for all to see. Ambulances were coming and going and she was a scared XX year old girl. When the pediatrician came everyone in the hallway was able to hear what was being said and after that I vowed I would try my best to never bring my children here again. She had to change in a disgusting bathroom and walk to the washroom in a gown with grown men and women all around. The staff overall were adequate as unless we asked for something no one offered anything and most walked by as if we didn't exist. The pediatrician helped by making sure sure she was followed up with, but the process is so broken. A XX year old girl should never be left that vulnerable in a hallway with someone at her feet and someone at her head, and others all around with no privacy. If a classmate had broken their arm, or required stitches and came to the hospital they would have heard everything going on with XXXXX and would have been perhaps sitting on a chair not far away from her.

Either a stretcher or lazy-boy type chair should be available to keep patients more comfortable particularly since diagnosis and treatment usually take hours.

I received a call that the ultrasound could not be done until XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. So I still do not have any answers what is causing my pain - I was very disappointed in the dr who seen me as I was in the most pain I have ever had, and I can tolerate pain on a high level - my RMT had suggested that I try to get anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxants as I was so enflamed. The dr. would not give me any meds, only instructed me to take Tylenol as instructed on the bottle. This was awful! I spent the next week in terrible pain and walking the halls during the night from the pain. Thankfully another dr from our dr's clinic called about a week later, and prescribed the anti-inflammatory and relaxants. I'm not sure why I wasn't given anything for pain at hospital? I'm not sure why I did not get ultrasound while at the hospital as the x-ray was inconclusive? I do understand that with Covid-19 things are running at a different level, but the hospital was far from busy and when I went for X-ray there was only 1 other person there - not busy at all! I am still thankful for our dr's and nurses and emergency dept., however this visit will not be graded for high - mainly because the dr. I feel was unsympathetic to the pain I was in.

Too many people at the hospital that shouldn't be there. The poor nurses have to worry about patients that are causing a scene instead of looking after patients that actually need care. Obviously we need more hospitals and not less. The wait time is so ridiculous. I'm sorry to say it this way but too many low life's there taking up time that the nurses could be spending with people that actually need the help. I smashed my head open and I got 8 stitches.

There was 1 drunk guy there who kept pulling out his penis in front of everybody and the nurse had to tell him to put it back in his pants. They shouldn't have to deal with that. Also, I understand that with this covid you don't want unnecessary people in the hospital but like I said I was scared and although might sound funny to you I didn't know if I was going to die or what might happen to me and they wouldn't allow my husband to be with me. I was alone in the hospital for 8 hours not knowing what was going to happen to me.

The 'nurse' (must be a fucking masochist, or just have zero clue about human biology and pain) used the brown kraft paper to 'dry off' a second degree burn. She then bandaged the burn without cleaning it in the slightest bit. I had to go home and pick out MELTED, BURNED PLASTIC from my strong hand using only my weak hand and some tweezers. I had no rubbing alcohol to sterilize my tools. THIS IS NOT CARE. This was a total waste of my time, I SHOULD have remained home where i had access to water, pain medications and PROPER towels which do not cause extra pain. This visit highlighted how absolutely pathetic the XXXXXXXXXXXX care system is. I recently moved to XXXXXXXXXXX, and had to attend emergency after having a nail puncture the same hand. The doctors and nurses actually care! Its not a problem that you're there... its not a personal inconvenience to them.

Because I was not allowed to stay with him, he was not able to properly convey his current issues such as his delirium, hallucinations, lack of sleep, no appetite, no liquids intake ongoing for 3 weeks. The attending ER physician actually prescribed him more NARCOTICS, which is NOT what he needed. He needed a Dr to actually look at and talk with him to truly begin a proper diagnosis. I understand the need to keep everyone safe and quarantine those who could be at risk, or cause risk to others. However, you neglected to account for the sick that cannot properly detail their issues. We ultimately had to take him back to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX where he was subsequently admitted to hospital, due to a large abscess in his abdomen, delirium, kidneys failing and now a recent finding of possible brain cancer. After clearly explaining his failing mental health I was handed a mask and allowed to stay with my husband when we arrived at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ER. The health team at XXX had no care or concern for the true health of my husband and as such he is now fighting for his life.

I had heard credible information that they were working hard to turn that around & needing to be transferred from XXXXXXXXXXX, I agreed to go. It was a very good experience on that visit & I was pleased. When I had another incident & was directed to go to XXXXXX by my neurologist I again went but found the same old problems existing. The neurologist had called ahead to tell them I was coming & left initial instructions. My difficulty that day appeared to be with the Charge Nurse. She was rude, arrogant, dismissive & did all that she could to ignore me. It was almost 6 hours & only 20 mins from her end of shift when I began to get attention. They held my health card for about 4 & 1/4 hours before I was registered & when I wanted to talk about how long I'd been waiting the Charge Nurse told me It had barely been an hour. I remarked to her that she might count the time from the moment of registration but I count it from the time they have taken my health card. Even using the time since I was in triage I had been waiting over 3 hours. When I finally got back into the treatment area (out of the waiting room) I was told there was blood work & imaging to be done & they would know more after those results were back. From that point the Charge Nurse was gone & things proceeded along pretty well. I had attentive staff (nurse, doctor & lab tech especially) & in about 3 hours I was ready to leave with a known follow-up plan. I received a bad cut on my hand recently, went to XXXXXX, was quickly put through triage & directed to the 'see & treat' area. Start to finish I was out in just over an hour with my laceration attended to. I was pleased to be sure & had been well attended & respected with obvious courtesy.

I was several hours in the hallway before I saw a doctor. Once I saw a doctor things started to fall into place as it were and a course of action was implemented to facilitate treatment. I am not one to complain but I was in very much pain and it seemed to be an eternity before anyone could really help me. Dr. XXXXXX was very professional, courteous, and helpful when I finally did see a doctor. I was very impressed with him. He even called me at home a few days later to see how I was doing! That was appreciated very much. The ER department needs to be expanded, given more funds, and more access of doctors and nurses to provide prompt treatment. I realize budgets are strained to the limit, governments are cutting back but surely XXX deserves to be at the top of its game in providing health care in a timely manner that meets the needs and dignity of patients. Our civic leaders and local XXX should be more proactive and work together in making this happen. XXX can't do this alone.

6167,Campbellford,General,Dear Sir or Madam I just want to thank Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXX for taking such great care of me. He was very caring and patient. When I went to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX by ambulance in a lot of pain I was transferred to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX right away for major surgery. After my surgery I was put in the I.C.U. for approx 5 to 6 days. While I was in the I.C.U. something happened and I had a code blue. The doctors took good care of me then I was put in the surgical wing for a week before being transferred back to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for some rehab because I could barely stand on my own. The only reason I am telling you all of this is because I had a night nurse that when I rang the bell for help she said to me that I should be able to do things on my own and should be at home. I felt this was not her decision but up to the doctor. I still remained in the hospital for a week after this happened. All the rest of the nurses were wonderful to me.

I ahd fallen and was experiencing acute pain in my back. I was seen by Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX who sent me for x-rays and he informed me that I had broken rib #8 and prescribed Tylenol (he also let me take a picture of the x-ray). This visit went very well. I returned to the Emergency Department on XXXXXXXXXXXXX as I had rolled over in my sleep and the pain had gotten much worse. THis time I was seen by Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXX. He asked me why I was there and I told him that I had broken rib #8 on the left side of my back At this time he became very belligerent and asked me how did I know that ... had I been for x-rays? I told im yes, that I had been up to emerg on XXXXXXXXXXXXX and had x-rays done at that time and that the dr. had told me that I had broken rib #8 and then showed him the picture He said that it might only be a cracked rib and not broken. He then pushed hard on my back in the area of rib #8 and then when I almost fell to the floor and could hardly breathe or talk his attitude completely changed and it seemed like he no longer thought that I was self-diagnosing and actually believed what I had told him. He immediately prescribed Morphine and told me to go home an rest and to take things easy. AFter he had pressed so hard on my back I was in substantially more pain than when I had originally injured myself. I ahd to go to my dr. on XXXXXXXXXXXXXX and was prescribed more Tylenol and an anti-inflammatory AS I said earlier in this letter my first visit to emerg went very well but hopefully I will have NO further dealings with Dr. XXXXXX.

6746,Campbellford,General,"Response to Yes, somewhat - its not clear. Very busy night - One of the questions should refer to how busy was the Emergency Dept This would have a huge impact re ""how busy"" the Emergency Dept is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Ref. 41 - Is there anything else you would like to share about your Emergency Department visit? 1. XXXXXXXXXXXXX, approx 10:00 p.m., admitted to Emergency Department, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - reason ""accident"". - Doctor on duty: Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - Emergency Department: a very busy night! - Injury: not life threatening. - Doctor's evaluation: assessed situation, froze area, waited for freezing to take place then sewed gap up on leg - 18 stitches. - Timeframe: 4 hours (10:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m.) - Doctor and nurses were excellent; the doctor got called out a couple of times and the last six stitches I felt as the freezing was gone. Dr. XXXXXXX did an excellent job and I am thankful. 2. XXXXXXXXXXXXX, 2:15 a.m. - admitted to the Emergency Department, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (it's a one hour drive to reach the hospital). - Experiencing a lot of pain just above where my wound was; I am not one to complain but it didn't feel right and decided to drive to the Emergency Department. - I was seen immediately by Dr. XXXX, he gave me two pills called Cephalexin; prescribed it for a 10 day period and ordered an ultrasound - the concern being a blood clot. I was instructed by Dr. XXXX that after the ultrasound I was to go to the Emergency Department nad not leave the hospital. Timeframe: 1/2 hour (2:!5 a.m. - 2:45 a.m.) - The hospital phoned me the next morning with an ultrasound appointment scheduled for 1:00 p.m. XXXXXX afternoon on XXXXXXXXX. 2. XXXXXXXXXXXXX, 1:00 p.m., ultrasound department, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - I was taken right away and had the procedure done - very prompt and efficient. - Timeframe: one hour (1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.) - 2:15 p.m., Emergency Department - As directed by Dr. XXXX, and the ultrasound department, I checked in the Emergency Department to await the results of the ultrasound. - The Emergency Department has a full house and was extremely busy. The doctor and nurses were literally ""run off"" their feet. Doctor on duty: Dr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - ""Wait time"" to see doctor for results 2:15 p.m. - 4:45 p.m approximately, called into a ""waiting room"" and I sat for another hour. - Doctor came in and gave me my results from the ultrasound - five minutes, the wound was redressed by a nurse. A total of almost four hours to tell me my ultrasound results were normal. - Timeframe: 2:15 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. A SOLUTION: absolutely an emergency situation has ""top priority"" , but for me, I am not a priority but I wonder if it is at all possible to say, after the doctor hs read the normal results - no blood clot; release it to a nurse/nurse-practitioner and have them give you the results. This would free up much needed space. There is such a shortage of doctors and nurses plus funding issues. I so appreciate all that the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX has done for me.

7064,Campbellford,General,When I was to be transferred from Emerg. to 1st floor a nurse came in and put me in a wheelchair.  She left and came back to tell me I had to wear a yellow gown & gloves.  I told her I couldn't get the glove on my hand that had the intervenous in and she pushed the glove on me and it hurt quite a bit.  She left again & came back and rammed my belongings into a bag and piled it and the intervenous bags on my lap.  She wheeled me to the elevator & I told her that I had left my watch & bracelet back in Emerg room.  She kept on pushing me and said to me that my health was more important than my jewelry.  When I got to my room she said get up and I was still piled on with intervenous & belongings and I have Parkinson's so it is difficult to move or get up without anything on my lap.  Once again I asked her to call down about my watch and bracelet.  Once again she said to me what is more important to me - my health or my jewelry.

7110,Campbellford,General,"Yes, before I went into emerge I called xray dept to find out when they closed & waited by the person who answered the phone the 1st time I called emerge. as the xray dept didn't answer. Then I spoke with a human after. They were opened 24h. To clarify I said so if I have to go in & needed xray would they be opened later. I was reassured they were opened & someone would be there if it was determined I needed to go as I wasn't dr. so she said again 24/7 & would put me through to the emerge so they could confirm it. So I retold my story again & was reassured by nurse (but turned out to be the person that gets all info & gives the papers & hand tags that spoke to me & she gave me the wrong info as I had explained what happened & I didn't want to have to go back if no xray dept was available (saw her the next day & she said it was her). So next person in emerge said same thing - yep xray open 24 hrs & if need to go someone would be available & I explained I called so I didn't want to have to go back & have to wait around AGAIN! Then later on went in so hubby had to drive me in and the triage nurse was very rude not courteous but we put up with her. She told us we just missed it as they closed 15 mins prior to our getting there. Of course I was upset because then I had to go back to the hosp. again which was what I was trying to avoid in the 1st place!! I explained to her that I called the xray dept & got no answer so ended speaking with switchboard (?) & she gave me the wrong info even though I explained about calling xray dept. & got no answer & wanted to know when they would be opened to avoid a return drive to the hosp! When I did go to triage she explained they don't open 24 hrs & I explained what I had been told she said they only opened till 11:30 p.m. not 24 rs or have any xray tech on call unless life or death & doctor told me that as well. He was quite good & respectful the 1st doctor I saw. It's always the nurses who are usually rude & disrespectful! So of course I saw the doctor & he checked my arm/shoulder injury & said needed xrays so to call first thing as asked what time & if I had to go through the whole scenario again he just said to go see them 1st thing. Sure enough next morning I had to sit & wait for triage. After I went to xray & waited & waited for someone to show up I even went looking for someone! Then finally got the xrays & they said to do the registration thing again & wait for the xrays. Which is why I hate the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX as the give you the wrong info & you wait & wait & then find out you do the wrong things after waiting!! So I will not be supporting the hospital there when go to XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXX or XXXXXX!! Both doctors & lab tech I saw were nice but everyone else was a real pain! They need sensitivity despite their work load!! If they working longer then hire more people & provide customer service training!! Maybe more nurse practitioners!! Now to continue ... on the second day after I had to go back to emerge & register & sit & wait for results again & waited in wrong area again then found out they had the xrays & should have gone to register then wait in the emerge waiting room! So took another four hrs to wait. I did go to the nurses to find out how much longer & they said they had to wait for radiologist to read it (xrays) from XXXXXX to send it & give info & they didn't know when that would be. Again nurses - it's wait-wait-wait -> After waiting a long while again -> my daughter went out 2x in this waiting game!! -> and so I went back into the nurses & asked again - any news - as it was getting tiring & in pain - pills weren't helping -> This time while being told no news a doctor stepped up & said waiting on news from xray radiologist from XXXXXX - he said he could read xrays & nurses looked at him. Then one of them got up as she had been doing some paperwork & no doubt, after she went by him - to say wait for XXXXXX so again I sat & waited & waited! en finally that same doctor called me and then explained & rechecked my shoulder that it wasn't dislocated but that it showed no fractures (which was a relief cause it felt like it) but that I had separated the ligament from my ACV or something like that (the amaro clavicular bone?) so I could put it in a sling & would need physio - so I asked for a prescription & got one & he again explained better what I had done to my shoulder. He was nice & so was the first who took the time to test the arm & said I definitely needed xray on it & didn't dislocate it. 2nd doctor said also wasn't dislocated nor fractured (so happy to hear that part!). Now you know the full story & this needs to be given tot he hospital to be read do not put it in your own words! Copy it as is & pass the darn thing on so they can improve their service & having only 1 doctor one in evening is ridiculous as I must admit the first time I went in I didn't have a long time to wait to see him but the next day ... well a different story & surprisingly emerge waiting room was not as full but they did 1 person before me after he came after me!

often the adolescent beside her chose to stay up very late with lights on, etc_ I. feel a mandatory lights out policy would be effective, other
than when necessary moving patients in and out or for care by urging staff which is needed. This would have helped •my child immensely as
often she had trouble getting too sleep due to lights on beside her etc on another note, her appointments always coincided with her
morning school schedule which made her very anxious but there were no regular appointments available in the afternOon which was much
easier transportation wise for us to get too. Her last appointments were later in the day which has been so much better for us. Last
comment, when my daughter had a reaction to the Medication we tried to contact the Clinic and left a message to call us back as to course:
of action to take as there was no telephone message indicating that there were no doctors or staff on duty -. this caused us delay in going
to emergency as we were expecting a call back. A clear message explaining clinic is closed for day and to go to emerg for immediate
concerns etc.would be much appreciated. Another final comment would be that it was very frustrating after waiting many many months
for a psychology appointment for my daughter due tilliNgilimany many months), it was deemed that she did not require any follow up
after her initial evaluation. From a parent perspective who has dealt and done everything possible accessing psychotherapist in training
outside of city while waiting because from our end as wait lists in city privately are impossible to get on, she does need to see a
psychologist.to get to the root of the problem. I feel the child while doing the assessment can manipulate the answers and instead should
be offered at least one in person, if possible, appointment with a psychologist to truly delve into the problems which caused and continue
to cause problems. I strongly believe•rather than treating just the illness medically by doctor, all patients. need to be guaranteed
even minimal psych or social worker appointments so as not to relapse. It is a critical component of healing. I understand wait times in
terms of many months but after waiting that long I felt that she was just dismissed while she still has issues which cause medical problem

or it was the weekend at which point I would take it to the hospital. When I took it to XXXXXXXXX they accepted it? however when I was leaving they came running and told me they couldn't take it and handed it back to me. Any confidentiality was lost as they sang out my name in front of everybody that was sitting there and told me to go to the hospital with it. When I went to the hospital they told me they didn't take and I would have to go back to XXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXX was now closed but they agreed to take it but told me it shouldn't happen again like it was my fault. My point is that I tried to be very discreet with the type of test being done and patient confidentiality was completely lost and I was concerned about whether it was being handled by the correct people. I just have to say when you wait to see a doctor as long as you have to wait these days and the doctor has a time frame to deal with your issues and tells you he can only deal with a couple of issues and you will have to come back to deal with the other's.

7898,Dryden Regional Health Centre Comments,General,Minor glitch with my medication I was shown a list of the medication I would be receiving. There was 5 different ones when I check out they fax list over to shoppers. When pick up only 4 I called the pharmacy and they would fax something to the Doctor's office and inquire. It was XXXXXXXX night and the office was open until noon on XXXXXX but they may not see the fax. I phoned XXXXXXXXXXXX at the nursing station she was not on duty women that I talked to said she would check she called back and only 4 was correct. The 5th was not needed to take at home. Second more importantly that cause anxiety was that I was told I could not get out of bed I have a secondary issue nothing to do with why I was in there but I have to do something when I have a bowl movement and could not use a bedpan. I explained to the nurse manager don't know why doctors order it was like this is the way it is going to be and we are not going to listen. Most stressful at the hospital I would like to find solutions go to ED I was formal first aid instructor we are told don't assume what is wrong but do a scan and talk to people and the same should be done.

8069,Dryden Regional Health Centre Comments,Service Alert,"The hospital needs more staff. All hospitals should all have a dark quiet room for people with migraines so you don't have to hear all of the things going on. They should have rooms with proper
heating as well. I wish I was on the hospital board but I never find out when they have board meetings or are asking new people to join . I guess I'll put it out to a friend who is a nurse there. The hospital thinks they can give proper care
by just changing a few things. They need to not have people walking out. They need to come up with a strategic plan to get patients in and out. There is a lot of change that needs to happen in the hospital. The staff are usually pretty friendly and stuff but there have been some very rude nurses in the past. They need some continuing education on proper skills and confidentiality. I have heard of people talking around town.
They need to make sure confidentiality is being adhered to. The last thing someone wants is to hear that their information is being shared around town. I went to the hospital a different time as a care person with someone who was sexually assaulted. We were there for hours. It would be helpful to try to get those people in and out as quick as possible to reduce anxiety. The nurse had to keep leaving and carrying everything in and out. My thought was what if the nurse fell and the evidence went away then they would have to do the rape kit all over again. My suggestion is that they have a box for the rape kit and the envelope to ensure the evidence is staying safe. There was an on-call nurse that came but she took a long time to get there. They should have more nurses specifically trained for that and doing things in a timely fashion. When someone has gone through something as traumatic as rape they want to go home and they don't want to be seen. Thankfully they got her into a room right away but it was a long waiting process. Maybe just thinking outside of the box to make it more comfortable for women who have gone through that situation.",2021-09-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Emergency (Phone),"Access/Coord of Care, Emotional Support, Nurse/Nurse aide, Physical Comfort, Respect to Patient",2021,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

8235,Dryden Regional Health Centre Comments,Service Alert,"Well I'd just like to say that I had been there the day previous and when my wife and I went in there were 4 people waiting so I had thought that wed get in quite quickly. The day before I had been
coughing up a lot of blood sometimes drowning in it. We got there early afternoon shortly after the room had filled with native people and by 6:30 at night the room had emptied. My wife went up and asked if we could have a place for me to lay down and the receptionist said you'll just have to wait your turn so I then informed her I was going home to lay down. So then the next morning we arrived early and I was taken into a room immediately and sat there for I think an hour and 15 minutes in this little room where renovations were going on. Then a nurse came to talk to me and ask me questions then they came back and informed me I was going to have an x ray. The x ray department was incredible. They sent me back to the room and then everyone that was helping me starting wearing masks and they brought me a mask. Then the Doctor came in and in a nutshell this is what she told me I'm going to give you antibiotics which I was already on but she changed them to what she thought would be more acceptable. She basically said I don't
know why you came to see me even though I was coughing up blood. Then when Doctor XXXXXXX came back a few days later he was furious. He saw my condition and that I was coughing up blood and he said the emergency should have ordered a ct to see why I was bleeding so much. Now I did have a ct and that department was absolutely awesome. Previous to this my sister and brother who are both younger than I both passed away of cancer and their treatment at XXXXXX was wonderful they did an amazing job.

8236,Dryden Regional Health Centre Comments,General,"Well, I would like to share my experience at the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
I hope you will read this, XXXXXX morning on XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I was driven to the emergency department at XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX by my wife after I had cut my hand on a table saw. Shortly after 11 AM I sat down at the emergency room check in when a young lady (receptionist) took my health card info and asked what happened. Immediately after this information was given I was ushered into a room where ""shortly"" thereafter a nruse checked my hand and asked if I could move my fingers, I did, she said good because you just missed a tendon. She said I'd need stitches. I asked if she could clean the cut, she did then she wrapped my hand in guaze and said to tell the receptionist if it bled through and I returned to the waiting room. After an hour, or two it was (unreadable) I was the only patient in the waiting room. The second patient in the waiting room was an elderly gentleman who arrived at least 1 hour after I had been waiting and then the 3rd emergency patient arrived, an elderly woman with assistance (daughter possibly) During my wait I returned to the receptionist because the cut had bled through the wrap, coincidentally the nurse I had seen was there and commented I would be in shortly. I observed during my wait 2 groups exited the emergency doors and did not return and the only other people who entered the emergency room were the man and woman who arrived after I, and were still there when I left. I also observed maybe 1 - 1:30PM, paramedics were in the emergency room. (I didn't hear sirens, but I would guess they brought someone in) Approximately 2:30PM (ball park) the elderly gentleman received a phone call on his cell and he said ""I've been here over an hour and there's only 3 people in the emergency room"". Pretty much immediately after that I said to my wife we were leaving, she said tell them your leaving, it's just common courtesy. At that time I returned to the emergency room receptionist and told her she could take my name off the list (common courtesy), I did also ask 'is it possible to get a couple of those bandaids that hold to cut together. She excused herself and a lady (I'm assuming a nurse) opened the door to let me in (Same room I went in originally, as did the other 2 patients waiting in emergency). She asked the question ""Do you need stitches"" I answered ""Yes"" (Based on my initial/first encounter when I checked in and then I asked one question ""Is it possible to get a couple bandaids that hold the cut closed"". Her answer ""Go to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I was speechless the only thing I said was ""you brought me in this room to tell me that."" I never asked or requested to see a doctor to her or anyone else, kind of obvious.) The first nurse said I'd need stitches, the second one didn't, look at my hand offer a bandaid, but I'm sure has taken bandaids, etc. to her home on occasion. This was the worst experience ever. A joke. the individual and hospital should be ashamed of themselves - XXXXXXXXX PS As if this is going anywhere, another waste of time.",2019-10-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,Emergency (Mail),"Access/Coord of Care, Admit/Registration, Emergency Dept, Nurse/Nurse aide",2019,3108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

8261,Dryden Regional Health Centre Comments,General,"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX was dealing with the ER admittance that night. I had been throwing up constantly for hours, my sister and I believed there was blood in my vomit and I could not talk, walk or think properly due to my poor condition. XXXXX was very cold and did not listen when my sister tried to explain what was going on as I had recently started taking new antibiotics so she figured it had something to do with that. I was unable to talk for myself so it would be of most importance if my sister was able to help answer questions. XXXXX completely ignored her when she tried to explain and shunned her away. As my sister believed she was shunned due to COVID restrictions and precautions, she called the hospital to further explain so the doctors and nurses could treat her with appropriate care. XXXXX answered and was again, very cold, impatient and told her that there was an ambulance on the way and that she 'better make it quick', implying that my care was not crucial. My sister was very appalled about this as no one should be treated like that, especially at the time when I wasn't doing well. XXXXX did not offer any compassion. She sat me in a chair and left. I could not hold myself up as I had a broken hand and was very weak. When I asked for a blanket because it was cold, she threw the blanket at me without coming in the room. I could not adjust the blanket myself as I had a broken hand and an IV in the other. The other nurse eventually fixed it for me but I was very cold for a while and felt there was no concern by XXXXX for my well-being. I do not want this to happen with me or any other patient in the future as no one deserves the kind of care that she treated me with. Please take appropriate action or do not have her deal with emergency patients as she made a terrifying experience worse than it should have been.

I think if she wasn't there that evening I would have left because I couldn't control my behavior. My spouse had no effect on the staff either. I felt embarrassed & humiliated at how I was treated. I work with a physician who worked in this ER & quit! He claimed nursing staff was extremely slow & spent too much time complaining or socializing. I'm angry to think this is our community ER. I have been in other ERs. The staff needs to be watched as to how they do their work (for a while) there is always room for improvement - All staff in ER should be watched (not always) from time to time & without their knowledge.

8513,Erie Shores,Emergency Department,"I am filling this out as a parent. My daughter is XXXXX and suffered a fracture on her growth plate. We waited 3 hours in the waiting room with her screaming in pain pretty much the whole time. A nurse came out 2 hours in to the wait and gave her Tylenol which made her fall asleep eventually. Once in a bed we were sent for another x-ray of the good leg (bad leg was done upon arrival) because the doctor couldn't tell (hear this is common with growth plates). At this point we were there for 5 hours at which the doctor informed us that there was no radiologist to read the scans (It was XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ... but It's a 24 hour hospital ... ??). So, the doctor told me to take her home and they would call us once the radiologist was available again. At 10:30 (3 1/2 hours later) I called there and was told they would call me right back. 5 minutes later I received a call and was informed that they don't know what happened and that the report was there and that they must have missed it. I was then informed that it was fractured and that we needed to bring her back in so it could be stabilized (she was sleeping). I brought her back to the hospital and waited an hour before the doctor came in to put a temporary cast on it and was then informed to take her to the fracture clinic at 5:45 am in XXXXXXX (an hour away) ... it was after midnight at this point and much later once I got her home and settled in. In my opinion: We should have had things read by 7 pm that night. The wait was one thing but the fact that there was no one available to do a vital job is unacceptable. We should have never been sent home without a temporary cast put on. She could have caused more damage in the 3 hours! Once we went to the fracture clinic in XXXXXXX things were much better and we have had great care there.

She had a big wound on her head with blood all over her hair and face. When eventually a male nurse stapled the wound, he hit one staple right INTO the wound instead of over it. When I mentioned this to him, he simply trivialized it, waived it away. This nurse was not qualified for his work, neither is the management of this hospital. I've been there before with one of my other children, with the same result. He had a cut in his forehead that needed to be glued. After this the doctor put a small bandage over the wound but he did this lengthwise instead of across the wound in order to hold the skin closely together. A doctor of all things. And also a very long waiting time, more than 4 hours. This hospital is a shame for the year we live in.

A man was their with 2 children who were definitely sick & three others. I told my daughter I am not going to stay. To me this is not an emergency ward its a joke.

8762,Erie Shores,Emergency Department,"I'm sure you will know what I'm about to write - judging by the bar cod eon the bottom of the pages ... go to ER w/ a XX year old in pain - 10 PM - brought in 4 hours later - 2 AM. Once I mentioned the guy who left to get a Tim Horton's coffee - and came back with his friend - went in before us. No exam done, did not 'listen' to my son - told us he is a ""teenager"" probably constipated - take Metamucil - sent us home. (Did I mention he had acute appendicitis!!!) So - now we have to go back when his shift is over - because we're denied care - go back in the morning - my son is in tears - can't sit, can't stand - crying, bent over in pain - mentioned we just left ER a few hours ago - (yet I'm still asked if I have a fever, a cough, and have I been away ... seriously!?) I ask how long is the wait - at least 5 hours the triage nurse tells me - I tell her to look at my son. He will not make it 5 hours in this pain. We have to sit on the floor in a hallway - because there are not more seats - nice. After I call someone, my son is brought in - it's morning - after an xray 8 hours nothing - they call in a tech to do an ultrasound - who is obviously upset with us that she was called in! She looks at all of abdomen, except the appendix ... wow. After how many injections of morphine - it's 8 PM at night and they still can't figure out what is wrong - so a CT is done - (perhaps if ultrasound was done properly - he wouldn't have needed the CT & all the radiation). Appendix - now it's almost 11 PM - they have to transfer him to XXXXXXX they want us to wait 2-3 hours for an ambulance - even though, it's been over 24 hours since I first came to ER with my son I took him myself! Embarrassing for XXXXXXXXXX. My family does not frequent ER - we don't abuse doctor visits - perhaps - instead of being taken in my ""turn"" of arrival (which certainly was how it worked) it should be my another priority - if I had to choose between a XX yr old crying - or a XX year old who ran out to get coffee with his friend - I'm guessing the XX year old - first. Perhaps you should view the frequency of ER visits by the patient - perhaps you should see what those frequent visitors are coming for - are they really emergencies?? Perhaps, at night when no doctors are working - you should staff 2 doctors - or 1 doctor and a nurse practitioner - perhaps - instead of wasting time printing off surveys - you should have someone to observe thing s- review the ER reports & do something about it.",2018-11-01 00:00:00,Negative,,,2018,2488,,Medical Error and Incompetence (Misdiagnosis),Medical Error and Incompetence (Direct Medical Care),Wait Times,Capacity Issues,,,,,Sakeina,Before December 2 2022,,,no_sdoh

First time in ER they did not tell me where the call button was, neither was reachable from my bed, no way to reach them as they were all at the reception, not a soul on the corridor to call. I was done left unattended. I was loosing a lot of blood (miscarriage) and my IV liquid solution was empty for at least 20 min. I was super week, tried to call for help without success. I had to leave my bed to see if someone was in the corridor (my room door was open all the time) not a soul I was so week that I fainted Not sure how long I was unconscious but I woke up still on the floor and managed to put myself on the bed praying for someone to come as I felt I will faint again At the end a nurse finally came to check on me. I had blood in my face because of the fall They put two IV liquids to bring me back to stable state Other issue, after the accident, they offer pain medication They gave me morphine. They did not tell me it will bring down my blood pressure (that was already low). When I start feeling worst with the morphine and the monitor equipment started to launch and alarm every time it measured my blood pressure I called them to let them knew with the call button (after the accident they finally showed me where the call button was and make it reachable from my bed). As the alarm did not go away on its own and no nurse happen to listen to the sounds (again nobody on the corridor) The nurses will only turn off the alarm remotely, as nobody came to check on me. They did not try to improve my blood pressure. They should have removed the medication but not the blood pressure monitor will launch the alarm every time it check automatically my pressure, and the nurse at the front will remotely turned off after I called her. This happens during the night not able to rest because of the alarm, and how bad I felt due to low blood pressure I have to say once they changed the nurse shift to the morning, the new nurse was better. She will come to check on me, change the IV liquid promptly and kept my blood pressure higher (above 90). No comparison to the night shift nurses I decided not to accept any more pain medication after what happened with the morphine",2020-01-01 00:00:00,Positive/Negative,,,2020,2465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no_sdoh

9093,Erie Shores,Emergency Department,"The nurse practitioner I saw could have dealt with many visits to that emergency room. Most of the people who were with me those two nights could have been prescribed medication and visited their doctor the next day I live in a small town and the people I knew from teaching in the community did not have a regular doctor, consequently they have to visit the emergency room when clinics close! Both my visits were after 8 pm. No clinics open after 8 pm! If I had gone to a walk in clinic, I've always had good success! Less than and hour wait. My emergency room experiences were positive. The followup at the local clinic was exceptional. A 5 hour wait seems extreme but my car mechanic never sees me when I need him after 8 pm. We live in the best country in the world. It sickens me that people complain about our medical system, which far surpasses the U.S.! My comments to people who complain is move back to your country of origin or if you were lucky enough to be from XXXXXX, be grateful and ""shut the fuck up!

He was so dizzy that he was vomiting for 8 hours. Finally after I insisted, he was given fluids through an IV and some medication to help with his nausea. XXXXXXX has an epilepsy disorder and is developmentally delayed with low vision There was a fellow across the hall who was brought in by the police for a DUI. The security office at the hospital was trying to watch him while doing his work The man with the DUI kept trying to take out his IV, with a knife, scissors and he kept trying to leave We felt unsafe too. Some nurses were very good. Another one tried to make XXXXXXX go home while he was still vomiting and dizzy. They were trying to make him eat and drink, which made him more sick.

This day that I attended the ER was full I had to wait until there was a free cubicle They had already by that time had 4 Covid cases. They were really busy. Unfortunately, I came in because I was in excruciating pain and didn't now what was causing it. So having a patient with undetermined pain didn't seem to be a priority. The doctor did a cursory check, I had informed him where the pain was travelling, he focused on my back. I had pain in the front, as well. He gave me a muscle relaxant - but that didn't help my pain. When I was at home the following day I had shingles that spread all around my torso on the (R) side. I was disappointed with this visit I thought the doctor could have spent more time & listen to all I had to say about my pain I felt like I was being treated like I was a ""druggie"" looking for a ""fix"", or a hypochondriac Other times I have been to the ER I have been treated extremely well.

XXXXXXXX Pat was sent to the emerg (by ambulance) from her doctor's office. She was to weak to walk and was falling. 11 hrs. later she as told she was not sick enough to keep in the hospital. 3. XXXXXXXXX Back to emerg. Passing out and falling (still) After about 6 hrs. doctor came in and told her she was being admitted. He left and she climbed off the end of the bed. She was trying to climb back into bed when I walked in. She fell and has one very bad black eye and bleeding. They sent her for a CAT scan to make sure there was internal bleeding. She was told at 3:30 ish they had a bed. 7:30 moved to room XXXX. 11:30 ish moved to ICU after turning purple. Dr. XXXXXX came in next morning and right away sent her for an echocardiogram. Dr. XXXXXX reported next a.m. it was a massive heart attack. XXX was stabilized and moved to room XXXX. She was on an alarm but climbed out of bed and pulled out her catheter. XXX was there for 6 days and sent home. 3. XXXXXXXX XXX sent for chest x-ray - pneumonia - antibiotic. Sent to emerg at 12:30 and got admitted at 7:30 ish At 7 XXX's lips turned blue and nurse checked her. Got admitted at 7:30 ish after waiting for ambulances from XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX to be admitted. Hospital wanted to admit her at 11:00 p.m. but we refused. The pneumonia is causing delirium and XXX does not know where she is or what is happening. This is from experience from last 2 bouts. We are not blaming the nursing staff as we understand they are under staffed and can not watch every patient 24 hours a day. It is the system. There are not enough rooms or nurses (let's close some more XXXX).

9418,Georgian Bay,General,"Because I'm a frequent flyer the triage nurse was not kind or respectful to me.  She never asked me any covid questions or any questions about my pain and discomfort.  Did not ask me to rate my pain, did not ask what it feels like and didn't ask what I have tried for the pain at home.  She asked everyone else these questions but not me.  After I was waiting for a bit I went and asked if I was going to a room or see and treat.  The reason I asked this was because if they were just sending me to see and treat I would know they are not taking me seriously and I was going to go home because I was in so much pain sitting I could know longer take it.  I was told I was going to a room so I stayed because I knew I'd have a bed to lay down on.  Then next thing I know I'm being called to see and treat!  Couldn't lay down.  The nurse there was kind.  The doctor was also excellent.  Do you know why?  Because I had my medical POA on speakerphone.  That's because I'm sick and tired of not being listened to and treated like shit.  My family all believe your hospital will kill me one day.  Not every frequent flyer is drug seeking.  I never ask for anything for pain.

They took my temperature and blood pressure and put me in a separate waiting room for an hour.  Then took to another room where I sat in a chair and leaned on the table.  After another hour a doctor came in and told me there's 'no magic pill for covid.  Take Tylenol every 4 hours.  Sucks you feel shitty' he said 'shitty' no exam or anything but he said he'll send me for a chest xray to see if I damaged my chest by getting covid. Then left after another hour alone, I went looking for a nurse to ask for a glass of water because I needed to take my own Tylenol I had in my purse and I told her I was feeling nauseous, she told me water would make me worse but she guesses so. She never brought me one so I drank from the warm hand washing station in the room I was in. After another hour I asked about my xray and the same nurse said 'I called but they're not responding' I walked out of the hospital then since it was 3 am I was sick tired and frustrated and felt no care was going to be given.

9532,Georgian Bay,General,"I went to the XXX Emergency department after calling the office of my family doctor that morning; the nurse I spoke to directed me to do this due to the possibility I was experiencing a significant heart episode ( I had two high blood pressure readings and a burst blood vessel in my eye).  Upon arriving at your Emergency department I communicated my concern to the receptionist, who immediately sent me to a nurses' station. The nurse who greeted me there was curt and dismissive at first when I described my symptoms, including the high blood pressure.  When she took my bp it was 185/105, higher than it was earlier that morning.  She said little after that, and told me to wait until another nurse registered me.  This wait was about five minutes.  After this was done this nurse instructed me to sit in the waiting area with the other patients.  She did not say anything else, so I did as instructed, said nothing and sat down. I was in the waiting room for about two hours before being brought in by another nurse.  Note: the hospital had about half a dozen patients awaiting treatment and I was placed in this queue.  From this point on my experience was okay.  It took another hour or so to be seen by the doctor, an EKG administered by the nurse, and the doctor to follow up with and discharge me.  My two main points of concern for my visit was first the lack of courtesy, concern and empathy by the first nurse who dealt with me in Admissions, and second the overall lack of communication from everyone who dealt with me throughout my stay.  Fortunately I had no serious health repercussions from my hospital visit, so overall I rated my treatment as satisfactory.
